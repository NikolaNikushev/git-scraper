A complete Node.js project template using TypeScript and following general best practices.  It allows you to skip the tedious details for the following:

* Adding and configuring TypeScript support.
* Enabling TypeScript linting.
* Setting up unit tests and code coverage reports.
* Creating an NPM package for your project.
* Managing ignored files for Git and NPM.

Once you've enabled CI, test coverage, and dependency reports for your project, this README.md file shows how to add the badges shown above.  This project template even enables automated changelog generation as long as you follow [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org), which is made simple through the included [Commitizen CLI](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/).
