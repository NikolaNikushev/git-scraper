`python -m rich.block_bar`\r\n\r\n**Implemented:**\r\n- Block elements support \r\n  - left-aligned bars with 1/8-of-a-cell granularity on the right side\r\n  - right-aligned bars with 1/2-of-a-cell granularity on the left side\r\n- Render nothing when value is min\r\n\r\n**Not implemented:**\r\n- Render nothing when value is max\r\n- Color gradient blends between colors\r\n\r\n**Note:** `BlockBar` might not be the best name.
