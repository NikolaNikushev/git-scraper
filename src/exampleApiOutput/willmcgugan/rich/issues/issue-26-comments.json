If I force Rich to enable styles they do work.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is detecting the size of the terminal. When running in Jupyter, the size is detected as the size of the terminal running the server, not the output area on the screen. This leads to things wrapping incorrectly and breaking tables etc.\r\n\r\nI'm sure some form of integration is possible. Still thinking of how it should work.
