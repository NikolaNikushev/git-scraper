Similar to what Tibbles do, I would show as many columns as possible starting from the first column (and possibly abbreviating columns with long contents, see e.g. the column `genus` in the R screenshot). If all columns (even with abbreviated contents) cannot be displayed, there could be a short summary at the end saying how many columns are not shown.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer the R behavior (show the first N columns) as opposed to the Pandas behavior (show the first N/2 and last N/2 columns).\r\n\r\nThe same things should work similarly for rows (with a separate parameter).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this feature is interesting for objects other than Pandas data frames. If you think so, then it would certainly be a good idea to add this to the `Table` class. If not, there has been some discussion about such a feature in https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/18066 - ideally, styling data frame output in the console would be directly integrated in Pandas (but maybe this can be done with Rich as well).","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/640471548","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/98#issuecomment-640471548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/98","id":640471548,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MDQ3MTU0OA==","user":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-08T09:03:18Z","updated_at":"2020-06-08T09:03:18Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"I'm not sure about building a column hiding feature in to the Table class itself.
