The pygithub package actually logs something along the following lines:\r\n`\"%s %s://%s%s %s %s ==> %i %s %s\"` (actually an URL with some additional data, the result of a request to the github API for some pull requests). However, when it comes to logging this, i get the following error : `MarkupError: closing tag '[//]' at position 27666 doesn't match any open tag` (along with an `KeyError: '/'`). \r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure, if this is a bug with rich or it's some unlucky interference with the way `pygithub` logs some things? \r\nSo this would be also my question: Is it possible to fix this with rich? Or should it even be no problem?\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCode is like the following (as its actually the last lines log that produces the error).\r\n```\r\ng = Github(mytoken)\r\nrepo = g.get_repo('some/repo)\r\n# query all open PRs\r\nlog.debug('Querying open PRs to check if a sync PR already exists.')\r\n# iterate over the open PRs of the repo\r\nfor pull_request in repo.get_pulls(state='open'): # this is the line, where pygithub logs the thing above and the \"errors source\".\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Platform**\r\nWhat platform (Win/Linux/Mac) are you running on? What terminal software are you using. Which version of Rich?\r\nRunning it on Ubuntu 18.04 with rich version 9.4.0\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"Imipenem","id":31141763,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxMTQxNzYz","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/31141763?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imipenem","html_url":"https://github.com/Imipenem","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imipenem/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imipenem/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imipenem/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imipenem/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imipenem/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imipenem/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imipenem/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imipenem/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Imipenem/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
