This seems related to recent https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/247 so I guess I am not the only one.\r\n\r\nI had code that produced both Markdown and tables and I wanted to display it all at once. \r\n\r\nBefore rich (or with classic ANSI) it was easy to concatenate the strings into a result and perform a print(result) at the end. \r\n\r\n**Details**\r\n\r\nI have practical example at https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint/pull/978/files where I am trying to print a list of rules using rich formatting. Our implementation allowed printing these using various formats where each format was a function returning a string.\r\n\r\nNow, with rich this really become an issue because I cannot return a string to be printed. In fact, even if I switch to use console.print() in all cases I am unable to return what is to be printed because each rule renders as a table. That is why in my initial PR, I tried to do console.print(table) for each rule and return an empty string.\r\n\r\nObviously that my implementation is more of a hack, and not a nice one. Is there a better way to implement that?\r\n\r\nMy hope was that maybe `render()` would return a string that I can later print, but apparently it returns a generator, so clearly not something that I can concatenate and print later.","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
