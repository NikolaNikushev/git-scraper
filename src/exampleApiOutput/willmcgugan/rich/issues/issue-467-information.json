I ran it on Windows 10 version 20H2. \r\n\r\n**Platform**\r\nHere are some examples (all run on Windows 10).\r\nThe upper row is an overview of multiple rich components (with finished progressbar), the lower row is always a picture of an unfinished progress bar.\r\n\r\nNew Version (v9.3.0)\r\n| PyCharm Integrated Terminal | CMD | Windows Terminal |\r\n| - | - | - |\r\n| ![](https://i.imgur.com/bbaad0t.png) | ![](https://i.imgur.com/6gA0COk.png) | ![](https://i.imgur.com/CZ0Hw6A.png) |\r\n| ![](https://i.imgur.com/DTQckhI.png) | ![](https://i.imgur.com/lPf6myz.png) | ![](https://i.imgur.com/BMV1lhQ.png) |\r\n\r\nOld Version (v4.2.2)\r\n| PyCharm Integrated Terminal | CMD | Windows Terminal |\r\n| - | - | - |\r\n| ![](https://i.imgur.com/2W1kJON.png) | ![](https://i.imgur.com/4oXnDdV.png) | ![](https://i.imgur.com/kwW7kYB.png) |\r\n| ![](https://i.imgur.com/ubbGuVE.png)| ![](https://i.imgur.com/Fl2BoAu.png) | ![](https://i.imgur.com/iqXYY0A.png) |\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"lagmoellertim","id":11356497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzU2NDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/11356497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagmoellertim","html_url":"https://github.com/lagmoellertim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagmoellertim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagmoellertim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagmoellertim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagmoellertim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagmoellertim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagmoellertim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagmoellertim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagmoellertim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagmoellertim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
