I suggest you to consider switching to binary prefixes (i.e. KiB, MiB, GiB, etc.) in order to have consistency with the number and its unit of measure and to remove the ambiguity regarding in which base the prefix is expressed: KiB, MiB, etc. are used exclusively with powers of 2, while I've seen KB, MB, etc. used with powers of 10 (as they should be) and powers of 2 (as in this case, but generally in casual conversations).\r\nFor instance, I tried with a file with a size of 6'988'379 bytes. Expressed in MiB it's 6,7 and this is the number printed by the progress bar, while in MB it's 6,9. As you can notice, while dealing with MiB vs MB the difference is ~5%, but when the size is bigger it can be ~7% (GiB vs GB), ~10% (TiB vs TB) and so on, so please consider using only one format.\r\n\r\nEdit: grammar","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
