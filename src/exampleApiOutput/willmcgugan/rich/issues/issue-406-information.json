There is a working example going with some extremely raw tests included `python -m rich.live`\r\n\r\n### Potential Areas of Concern\r\n- Lots of duplicate code exists between `Progress` and `Live`\r\n   - Perhaps they should share a common abstract parent class?\r\n- Limited by the height of the users console. \r\n   - Any tables or renderable larger than the display cannot be properly cleared (limitation of consoles). As such, the console begins to expand as parts of the \r\n   - There is a flag `hide_overflow` turned on by default, that will render \"Terminal too small\" when the renderable is too tall. This comes with some performance overheads of having to pre-render the Renderable to check its height.\r\n   - I'm curious if something along the lines of the `pager` functionality could be used on an oversized renderable\r\n\r\n### Tasklist\r\n- [x] Unit tests\r\n- [ ] Testing / considerations for an IPython console. Currently does the same thing as Progress.\r\n- [x] Documentation of usage\r\n- [x] An assortment of examples\r\n\r\n\r\n## Feedback\r\n\r\nLet me know if there are any features needed or different design decisions you would like to see.","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
