If you set `count` to 7000 or less then Rich is at least as fast or faster.\r\n\r\nI suspect tqdm is monitoring how long things are taking and adapting the rendering accordingly.\r\n\r\nRich progress bars probably are slower, it is generating color codes and its built on a multi-purpose rendering engine. Whereas tqdm has one job.\r\n\r\nThere's probably a few more optimizations I could make, but frankly its not going to make a difference in a real world task. In your example it takes 3930 milliseconds to do 1 million iterations. That means it will add an overhead of 0.004 milliseconds each iteration, which will likely be a tiny fraction of whatever work is done inside the loop. The difference is only going to be significant if your loop is doing virtually nothing...\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/663995614","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/176#issuecomment-663995614","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/176","id":663995614,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2Mzk5NTYxNA==","user":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-26T14:33:50Z","updated_at":"2020-07-26T14:33:50Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Try v4.1.0, it uses a different strategy for very quick iterations.
