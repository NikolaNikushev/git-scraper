I am planning to solidify the core features so that there won't be need need for much ongoing work. At that point I'd seek a new maintainer. Possible one of the current set of contributors if they still have an interest.\r\n\r\nI understand your concern, I've had similar experiences. In my experience projects become unmaintained because the code has collapsed under its own weight. This project is my chance to be more of a perfectionist that the day job, with high 90%s tests, documentation, and typing it should be easy to maintain well in to the future.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
