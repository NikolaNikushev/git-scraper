This screenshot from Google Drive is how I would like it to look like:\r\n![Sin tÃ­tulo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2606647/89203238-87f48500-d5b4-11ea-8be3-a0c91047bb5e.png)\r\n\r\nI'm almost at it, but I would like to change the style of the bar based on how much space is in use. For example, below 50% green, between 50% and 80% yellow and above that red. While working on this feature I think I hit a bug.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nThe following code should produce a blue bar inside a table. It mostly works, except that the pulse style is not blue but fucsia:\r\n```\r\nfrom rich.bar import Bar\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\nfrom rich.progress import BarColumn, Progress\r\nfrom rich.table import Table\r\n\r\n\r\nprogress = Progress(\r\n    \"[progress.description]{task.description}\",\r\n    BarColumn(pulse_style=\"blue\"),\r\n    \"[progress.percentage]{task.percentage:>3.0f}% {task.completed} MB of {task.total} MB used\",\r\n)\r\n\r\nprogress.add_task(description='Storage', completed=5, total=10)\r\n\r\ntable = Table('Example')\r\ntable.add_row(progress.get_renderable())\r\n\r\nconsole = Console()\r\nconsole.print(table)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe questions are:\r\n- Is this a bug?\r\n- My intention here was the subclass the BarColumn class to modify the style based on the current percentage. Is this the way to go?\r\n\r\n**Platform**\r\nWhat platform (Win/Linux/Mac) are you running on? What terminal software are you using. Which version of Rich?\r\nrich version 5.0.0 running on linux connecting through putty. \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!","closed_by":{"login":"ocurero","id":2606647,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDY2NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2606647?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocurero","html_url":"https://github.com/ocurero","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocurero/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocurero/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocurero/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocurero/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocurero/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocurero/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocurero/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocurero/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ocurero/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
