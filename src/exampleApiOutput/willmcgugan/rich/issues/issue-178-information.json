In certain cases, `rich.print` handles newlines in a slightly different manner than the `print` built-in.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\n>>> for i in range(3): print('Hey' + '\\n' * i)\r\n... \r\nHey\r\nHey\r\n\r\nHey\r\n\r\n\r\n>>> from rich import print\r\n>>> for i in range(3): print('Hey' + '\\n' * i)\r\n... \r\nHey\r\nHey\r\nHey\r\n\r\n>>> \r\n```\r\nApparently, when the printed string contains at least one trailing newline (i.e. when `i == 1` or `i == 2`), one newline is ignored by `rich.print`.\r\n\r\nA screenshot of a similar example:\r\n![rich](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43098013/88477785-33616200-cf43-11ea-9b6a-647ad0080f8b.png)\r\n\r\n(rich 3.3.2, Python 3.8.0, GNOME Terminal 3.18.3 on Linux Mint 18.2 64-bit)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
