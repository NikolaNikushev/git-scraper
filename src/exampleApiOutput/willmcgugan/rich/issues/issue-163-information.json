I've seen in your docs that you can pass the RichHandler() to `logging` to generate \"rich\" logs. \r\n\r\nhttps://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/logger.html#loguru._logger.Logger.configure\r\n\r\nHowever in my current project, we are using loguru, so I'm trying to figure out how to do a similar thing (if it's even possible), to pass RichHandler() to loguru, so I can generate these rich logs that are great.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if you could explain if this is possible, and if so share how it works, perhaps appending this detail to the rich docs [here](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logging.html).\r\n\r\nMy naive attempt at getting this to work:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom loguru import logger\r\nfrom rich.logging import RichHandler\r\n\r\nlogger.configure(handlers=[RichHandler()])\r\nlogger.debug(\"This is a debug statement\")\r\nlogger.info(\"This is an info statement\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I get fairly confused with the traceback. Hoping you may be able to enlighten me!\r\n\r\n**What problem does it solved for you?**\r\n\r\nIt would enable me to use rich formatting on logs in conjunction with the loguru package. Perhaps other users of loguru would be interested in this as well.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
