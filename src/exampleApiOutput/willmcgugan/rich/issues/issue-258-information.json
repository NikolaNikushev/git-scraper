I then add some text, explaining the source of the problem, in which either single identifiers or parts of a line of code  are inserted in a phrase using single backticks to identify as code. The lack of consistency in styling is less than ideal.\r\n\r\nNote: I have looked at rich's own code to see if I could monkeypatch it (which I do for some other things in my project) and could not find an easy way to do what I would like it to do.  I've also used markdown with Sphinx, which uses Python as a default for code blocks and found that it too was not rendering inline code as Python code with the appropriate pygments theme. As far as I could tell, it does not look like something that would be easy to do and would completely understand if this issue would be closed with \"won't fix\".  However, if it looks like it **might** be possible to monkeypatch rich (and/or commonmark?) to do this, I would appreciate if I could get some pointers as I would be willing to experiment further on my own.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
