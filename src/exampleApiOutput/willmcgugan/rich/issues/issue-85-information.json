I resorted to doing a formatting hack by not using vertical padding, inserting instead an empty row between each existing rows, so as to get the vertical spacing between rows just right (for me).  Here's a screen capture to illustrate what I mean:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/629698/82329435-b13f4500-99b7-11ea-964f-aab6155c6e8e.png)\r\n\r\nThis small hack works for me, but it might possibly be a nice feature to add, using bottom padding with an extra flag `skip_last_bottom_padding` -- if it is not too difficult to implement.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"aroberge","id":629698,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjYyOTY5OA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/629698?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroberge","html_url":"https://github.com/aroberge","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroberge/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroberge/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroberge/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroberge/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroberge/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroberge/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroberge/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroberge/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/aroberge/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
