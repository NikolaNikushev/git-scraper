Any punctuation will cause the `**` to be rendered as literals.\r\n\r\nIn fact, Github markdown does the same thing. Which makes this easy to demo. Here's the source:\r\n\r\n```\r\n**Hello**World\r\n**Hello.**World\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here's the output:\r\n\r\n**Hello**World\r\n**Hello.**World\r\n\r\nThis only effects inline styles that are inside a word (i.e. not separated by spaces). Put a space between Hello and World and it renders as you would expect.\r\n\r\nI suspect that the common mark spec just wasn't aware of this requirement for Japanese. One solution would be to insert a zero-width-joiner character in place of the space:\r\n\r\n```\r\n**Hello.**&#8203;World\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Hello.**&#8203;World\r\n\r\nWhich works, but it's not elegant. There may be a better solution I'm unaware of, you might want to read the [Common mark spec](https://spec.commonmark.org/).","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/714435700","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/400#issuecomment-714435700","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/400","id":714435700,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxNDQzNTcwMA==","user":{"login":"1dancook","id":12954427,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyOTU0NDI3","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/12954427?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/1dancook","html_url":"https://github.com/1dancook","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1dancook/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1dancook/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1dancook/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1dancook/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1dancook/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1dancook/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1dancook/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1dancook/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/1dancook/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-22T11:42:11Z","updated_at":"2020-10-22T11:42:11Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Okay thank you!
