Is that something you want to continue building on?\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have a more sophisticated framework of building prompts, similar to [questionary](https://github.com/tmbo/questionary) or [listr2](https://github.com/tmbo/questionary) for NodeJS. Questionary has arrow-key based navigation between \"menu\" items, listr2 offers options such as building multi-line outputs where part of the output can be refreshed, easy to use symbols (checkmark, question mark etc.), conditional outputs and so on.\r\n\r\n**What problem does it solved for you?**\r\n\r\nBuilding more interactive CLI tools.","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
