What I really need to be able to support, however, is a rapid input history access (via up/down arrows) and support cursor movements on a line of text. \r\n\r\nIs there a method for getting access to individual keystroke input with rich?\r\n\r\nMy target environment in linux but it would be nice if the feature was platform independent. I'm running Python 3.8. \r\n\r\nJust being able to use up arrow to repeat the last input command and (preferably) being able to edit it before executing would be a godsend in terms of usability improvements. Pretty much something like what bash presently offers.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"scherrey","id":878591,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg3ODU5MQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/878591?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/scherrey","html_url":"https://github.com/scherrey","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scherrey/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scherrey/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scherrey/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scherrey/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scherrey/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scherrey/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scherrey/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scherrey/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/scherrey/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
