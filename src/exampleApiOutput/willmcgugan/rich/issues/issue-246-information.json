And I also formatted all the code including ones in the example and tools directories.\r\n\r\n**Things I’m not sure about (edited and have done):**\r\n1. Need your opinion on changing it instead to `black --check .` (with the dot), so that all python files, like the ones in examples/ are formatted. Tried this locally and it seems fine\r\n2. Need your opinion about the naming in the Makefile: \r\n   * `black --check <whatever>` could be renamed to `make format-check`\r\n   * then `make format` could be instead `black <whatever>` - which would actually format the code\r\n\r\n\\* The \\<whatever> part depends on what you think about the dot thing (in 1.)\r\n\r\n3. The `make format` can be mentioned in CONTRIBUTING.md so people don’t have to search up black documentation to figure out how to do it (maybe?)","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
