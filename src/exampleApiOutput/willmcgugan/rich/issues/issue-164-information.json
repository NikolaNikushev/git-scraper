Yes, it is possible to enter None as a value, but this just leaves the existing cell empty and does not solve the feature for an alternate style of that rows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n|      Clock-in        | Clock-out | Duration |\r\n|                 8:00 |     10:00 |     2:00 |\r\n|                10:45 |     17:00 |     6:15 |\r\n| Sum of working hours |           |     8:15 |\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What problem does it solved for you?**\r\n\r\nThis feature would make the table rendering an even greater way to produce great tables for more representation use-cases than it can serve currently.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
