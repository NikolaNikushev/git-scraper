Really makes working in the CLI a joy.\r\n\r\nOne thing I was missing are progress bars that do not show a progress, but are basically a waiting indicator ([Example](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/ux-guidelines/notifications-and-progress-for-visual-studio?view=vs-2019#indeterminate)). I was able to build a version of it by having the bar go to 99% and then reverse back in a loop. Ideally, however, the progress bar would move, i.e. the startValue would change together with the endValue and the completed part would stay the same width.","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
