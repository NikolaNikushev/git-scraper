It does not occur with a regular print.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n````python\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\nconsole = Console()\r\nresults = {'result1':'something', 'result2':[1,2,3]}\r\nprint(f'Comment {results}') # this works as expected\r\n# outputs: Comment {'result1': 'something', 'result2': [1, 2, 3]}\r\nconsole.print(f'Comment {results}') # this nicely colours the structure but it has lost the list\r\n# outputs: Comment {'result1': 'something', 'result2': }\r\n````\r\n\r\n**Platform**\r\nArch Linux on x86_64\r\nTerminal software: Konsole version 20.04.3\r\nPython version: 3.7.6\r\nRich version: 3.3.2\r\n\r\nThis is hardly the most critical of issues, and there's an easy work around (`console.print(f'Comment ', results, end='')`) but as it is easy to miss, it might catch some people out if they're not aware of it.","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
