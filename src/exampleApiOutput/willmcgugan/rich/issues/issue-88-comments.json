It looks just like their is an extra space in there, but bizarrely there is no space in the text generated by Rich. I boiled the output down to the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> print(\"â”‚\\x1b[33m\\U0001F862\\x1b[0mâ”‚\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is no space in there after the unicode arrow, but there is clearly a space when printed in the Windows terminal. The arrow doesn't render in OSX or Ubuntu terminal as the glyph isn't in the default font, but there is no extra space.\r\n\r\nIt has to be a bug in Windows terminal, quite an odd one at that. I'll report the issue on their repos. This is actually the second unicode issue I've found. I'll forgive Microsoft, since Windows Terminal is very new.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, you might want to use another [unicode arrow](http://xahlee.info/comp/unicode_arrows.html), some of which look similar.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/633057905","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/88#issuecomment-633057905","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/88","id":633057905,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMzA1NzkwNQ==","user":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-23T13:51:53Z","updated_at":"2020-05-23T13:51:53Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"Not sure how long it will be before I get a response.

As far as I am concerned, you can close this issue.  \r\n\r\nAfter experimenting with the look of a few unicode arrows, I decided to stick with the ascii combination `-->` to represent arrows as I thought it would be easier to see when projected on a screen.  However, when I noticed the alignment bug when I used that particular arrow, I thought I should create a minimal example to illustrate the bug in case it was something you could fix before others stumbled upon it.  It took me a while to figure out that it was the combination of color code and this unicode arrow.
