This library is very easy to use and has a beautiful console style. I love it.\r\n\r\n**BTW, I ask you to add a little functionality to the `track` function in progress.

So I would like to know how many steps have progressed in the current epoch, not a percentage because of the number of checkpoints.\r\n\r\nWhen I try to add the text that shows current steps, I must define a new class that inherits from `ProgressColumn`, and create `Progress` instance as same to the `track` function.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3658421/87108486-6944ec00-c29d-11ea-96ae-4ac8bcfc7b8f.png)\r\n\r\nThank you for your attention to this suggestion.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
