For example, currently you have a caret dependency on colorama ^0.4.0. Your package is young enough so that this covers all newer versions. But if colorama outputs a version 0.5.0, and another package would use ^0.5.0, this would lead to an unresolvable dependency - and that although very likely there is no issue at all. \r\n\r\nThe caret operator is very conservative, assumes a strict adherence to SemVer on the side of the dependency that is often not the case.\r\n\r\n**What problem does it solved for you?**\r\n\r\nForward looking action to prevent dependency resolution problems in the future for projects with many dependencies. Other languages can use ^ much better as they allow multiple versions of the same package to be installed, but python doesn't. So ^ will over the long run lead to incompatible dependencies.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"hhoeflin","id":2385506,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIzODU1MDY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/2385506?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhoeflin","html_url":"https://github.com/hhoeflin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhoeflin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhoeflin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhoeflin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhoeflin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhoeflin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhoeflin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhoeflin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhoeflin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/hhoeflin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
