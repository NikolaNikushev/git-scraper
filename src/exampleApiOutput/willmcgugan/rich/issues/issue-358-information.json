It not exactly rich-related but I was hoping you could help me. \r\n\r\nTo create the images in the README.md of [pyinspect](https://github.com/FedeClaudi/pyinspect#tracebacks), I've been using [terminalizer](https://github.com/faressoft/terminalizer).\r\nHowever panels come out looking a bit weird:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17436313/95323634-66569900-0896-11eb-8b3b-270100677bac.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm using terminalizer because I can automate most of it and because the terminal image it makes have rounded edges and box-shadows that look much nicer than a simpler screenshot, but I'm open to better alternatives. \r\n\r\nDo you have any advice to improve the output of terminalizer, or better tools to create images showing rich's output as nicely as you do in the README of your repo?\r\n\r\nThanks for the help :)","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
