If you set *every* column to `no_wrap` you haven't given Rich any way of shrinking the table. As a last resort, Rich will reduce the columns evenly.\r\n\r\nI think you may have a misunderstanding of the overflow concept. Perhaps mock up what you expect to happen.\r\n\r\nYou will need at least one column that Rich can reduce. You can set `no_wrap=True` on a Text instance to prevent it from wrapping even if the cell is smaller than the optimal width. This may be closer to what you are looking for.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom rich.text import Text\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\nfrom rich.table import Table\r\n\r\nconsole = Console()\r\n\r\ntable = Table()\r\ntable.add_column(\"Column A\", no_wrap=True)\r\ntable.add_column(\"Column B\")\r\ntable.add_column(\"Column C\")\r\ntable.add_row(\"Foo \"*20, Text(\"Bar \"*20, no_wrap=True), Text(\"Baz \" * 10, no_wrap=True))\r\n\r\nconsole.print(table)\r\n```","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/657443751","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/157#issuecomment-657443751","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/157","id":657443751,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NzQ0Mzc1MQ==","user":{"login":"AcidWeb","id":3713734,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3MTM3MzQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3713734?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/AcidWeb","html_url":"https://github.com/AcidWeb","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AcidWeb/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AcidWeb/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AcidWeb/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AcidWeb/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AcidWeb/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AcidWeb/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AcidWeb/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AcidWeb/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/AcidWeb/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-13T09:33:20Z","updated_at":"2020-07-13T09:33:20Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you for explanations.
