I'm trying to see if we can use the RichHandler as our logging handler. A lot of our users use jupyter notebooks to run code.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the formatting has a lot of spacing peculiarities in jupyter (e.g., text looks big and vertical spacing between lines is large)\r\n\r\nI also tried setting my own Console with `force_terminal=True` and found that these lines are the likely culprit for the strange formatting\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/blob/a47bf8b66eebc65dc115400e018678f61f30266c/rich/console.py#L336-L339\r\n\r\nas `force_terminal=True` has no impact here.\r\n\r\nAnother caveat is that the formatting had no color in Google Colab unless I set `force_terminal=True`. Colab has a custom config of jupyter notebooks and perhaps has a stdout console?\r\n\r\nFor reference, [this](https://github.com/YosefLab/scVI/pull/726/files) is what I had to do to get the spacing to look good in a local jupyter notebook. The result of this is good spacing, but weird colors.\r\n\r\nBelow is the default before my changes:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-08-18 at 8 55 29 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10859440/90536185-92745a00-e130-11ea-8b6f-5bc2c6ca106b.png)\r\n\r\nand after changes:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-08-18 at 8 57 21 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10859440/90536375-d5363200-e130-11ea-9e6b-84d213f160d8.png)\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
