The library has been incredibly easy to get up and running with great output and not much overhead. I had looked between blessed and some of the python TUI frameworks, and rich sits at a perfect spot between the two!  I was able to very quickly get some nice output going without much overhead at all and it's been great.\r\n\r\nThe documentation and examples have been great at helping me work through problems, but it's possible I missed this feature. I'm basically doing a menu for a user interface, so I've been using a combination of blessed and rich. I use the input from blessed, and have some functions to make the rich renderables when it needs to redraw the screen.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that you cannot clear between redraws because the screen will flash, so you have to draw over top of the existing items by moving home and redrawing. If elements get shorter, you are left with lines that have old output, so you need to clear to the end of the screen as well.\r\n\r\nSo right now my draw function is basically:\r\nprint.(blessed_term.home )\r\nrich_console.print( ui_element )\r\nrich_console.print( ui_element_2 )\r\n...\r\nprint( blessed_term.clear_eos )\r\n\r\nI think it would be a nice addition if it were possible to add some of these functions to rich, but I understand if they don't fit the design or are not easy to put in there. \r\n\r\nAnother suggestion is added features for the column class. The first would be to change the background color of the space between renderables in the column. \r\n\r\nThe screen layout I have is, top to bottom, an expanded panel, an expanded table, then a column of several tables, then an expanded panel. The column had a lot of space to the right that that was the color of the terminal background. If I expanded the column, the gaps were still the terminal background color.\r\n\r\nWhat I ended up doing was manually calculating the width of the tables (table borders + padding + width of longest string element), then creating a final panel with box minimal that was the size of the left over space (term width - tables width) that shared a background color with other elements, then added 0 padding, and I had a nice solid background color change for all elements.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to just set the background color of the space between the renderables in the column class.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it would be nice to justify the column elements to the left/right/center/justified positions. Left stacking them to the left, right to the right, center smashing them together in the center, and justify doing what it does now when expand=true. \r\n\r\nAgain it's been wonderful working with rich and thank you again for writing it along with great documentation. One last suggestion is that I wanted to have a progress bar inside of a table and thought I couldn't do it until I saw the get_renderable function in the reference, which worked out wonderfully. Might be worth a mention on the progress page as I initially thought I could only use it at the bottom of the screen doing its thing instead of putting it up inside the elements.\r\n\r\ntldr:\r\n- console.move_home  console.clear_eos functions\r\n-Column background color\r\n-Column justify for elements left,right,center,justify\r\n-Mention progress.get_renderable() out in main documentation.","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
