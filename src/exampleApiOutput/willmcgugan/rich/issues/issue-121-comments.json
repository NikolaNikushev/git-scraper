Linux uses os.fork which means you will get a copy of the Progress object in the worker processes. When you call `progress.update` in `do_work` you are modifying a copy and not the original Progress instance. \r\n\r\nThe solution would be to use a single Progress object and update that in the main process. Something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\r\n\r\nimport time\r\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\r\n\r\nfrom rich.progress import Progress\r\n\r\n\r\ndef do_work(n):\r\n    time.sleep(1)\r\n    return n\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\r\n    with Progress() as progress:\r\n        task_id = progress.add_task(\"[cyan]Completed...\", total=100)\r\n\r\n        with Pool(processes=8) as pool:\r\n            results = pool.imap(do_work, range(100))\r\n            for result in results:\r\n                progress.print(result)\r\n                progress.advance(task_id)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope that helps.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/648736523","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/121#issuecomment-648736523","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/121","id":648736523,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0ODczNjUyMw==","user":{"login":"nvitaly","id":840175,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjg0MDE3NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/840175?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvitaly","html_url":"https://github.com/nvitaly","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvitaly/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvitaly/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvitaly/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvitaly/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvitaly/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvitaly/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvitaly/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvitaly/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nvitaly/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-24T10:25:58Z","updated_at":"2020-06-24T10:25:58Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Yes, that is it.
