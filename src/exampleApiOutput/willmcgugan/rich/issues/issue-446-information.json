Still, I do think that the version compatibility range should not have a ceiling bound unless it is already known to break the library.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly problematic with rich which is mostly a library, so it needs to play well with other dependencies the project may need.\r\n\r\nLets assume you make 9.2.1 hotfix today to sort this issue. What happens if dataclasses makes release 0.9 tomorrow, it will likely get into conflict with rich again, even if there is no proof that they do not work together. This is even more problematic as the ceiling seams to be applied to the minor version.\r\n\r\nIf the concerns around possible breakage produced by dataclasses are real, at least the conditions should look more like `<1.0`.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
