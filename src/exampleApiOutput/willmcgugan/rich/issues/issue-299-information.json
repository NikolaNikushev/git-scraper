The problem does not occur if I remove `import readline` from the script. But then the cursor keys don't work.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, code is:\r\n```\r\nimport readline\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\nfrom rich.theme import Theme\r\n\r\ncustom_theme = Theme({\r\n    'input': 'bold yellow'\r\n})\r\nconsole = Console(theme=custom_theme, highlight=False)\r\n\r\nch = console.input('[input]Enter choice: ')\r\nprint(ch)\r\n```\r\nEnter some text at the prompt, then delete it with backspace - the prompt gets deleted too.\r\n\r\n**Platform**\r\nOS - Linux (Ubuntu 18.04)\r\nTerminal - Default\r\nRich - 6.2.0\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"deb17","id":31579707,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMxNTc5NzA3","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/31579707?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/deb17","html_url":"https://github.com/deb17","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deb17/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deb17/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deb17/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deb17/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deb17/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deb17/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deb17/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deb17/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/deb17/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
