I'm trying it for the first time and it mostly seems to work, but [`Console.show_cursor`](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/blob/master/rich/console.py#L426) tries to write an ANSI escape sequence, which obviously doesn't work, the Windows terminal just prints out those characters. I don't know the equivalent magic to show/hide the cursor on Windows, but at least it should avoid printing those bytes","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
