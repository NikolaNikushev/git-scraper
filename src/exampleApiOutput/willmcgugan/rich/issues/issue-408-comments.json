Some emoji take up 1 \"cell\" in the terminal, others take up 2. The only way to know which is which is to look it up in the unicode database. The problem is that different terminal apps use different versions of the unicode database, and there is no way to detect which is which.\r\n\r\nThe upshot is that emoji will be broken on some terminals with identical output.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"987\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-10-25 at 11 38 44\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/554369/97106130-b49dd180-16b7-11eb-99d1-edc1257043fe.png\">\r\n\r\nRich uses version 9 of the unicode database, which is not the newest or the oldest.
