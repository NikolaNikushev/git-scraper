I have a stream of data that is being received which I want to format as a table. Since I have many rows, I would like to have the ability to print new rows as data is being received without the need to re-render the entire table. As it was said above, we will need to set column widths before printing. \r\nA code example might look like:\r\n```python\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\nfrom rich.table import ProgressiveTable\r\n\r\nconsole = Console()\r\ntable = ProgressiveTable()\r\n\r\ntable.add_column('test column', width=12)\r\n\r\ntable.add_row('first row')\r\nconsole.print(table)\r\n\r\ntable.add_row('second row')\r\nconsole.print(table)\r\n\r\ntable.finish_border()\r\nconsole.print(table)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhose output should be \r\n```\r\n┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓\r\n┃ test column  ┃\r\n┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩\r\n│ first row    │\r\n│ second row   │\r\n└──────────────┘\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuch a table would probably work by buffering the newly added rows before printing (only) them.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/733602780","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/312#issuecomment-733602780","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/312","id":733602780,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczMzYwMjc4MA==","user":{"login":"ssbarnea","id":102495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/102495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea","html_url":"https://github.com/ssbarnea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-11-25T10:00:34Z","updated_at":"2020-11-25T10:00:46Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"@giladreti Rich current main goal is to provide the building blocks for creating TUI applications. As my primary use case was for making console application output easier to read, I created a small extension called [enrich](https://github.com/pycontribs/enrich/) which focuses on progressive and fluid output (soft wrapping, for both console and logging).\r\n\r\nEven so this will may not work for tables because they can work only with a fixed layout and rich needs to decide how much space to give to each column and do the wrapping. I think you could emulate it by styling the table to render as a single row and printing each row as an entire table.\r\n\r\nTo be honest the rendering of UI elements is a very complex issue for which browsers spent decades improving and I doubt @willmcgugan has the superpowers to address it.\r\n\r\nFor the moment I avoid printing stuff as tables if progressive display is needed or if the total amount of printed rows is likely to be bigger than 1-2 screens.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
