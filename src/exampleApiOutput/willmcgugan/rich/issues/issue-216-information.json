So the question would be: is it possible (and how) to add html-like links to table without breaking it?\r\nI use tilix terminal that supports html-like links and when I print smth variable it works, and it works in a table too but also displaces right border of a cell. So request would be to enable html-like links in tables (maybe it already works but I don't know how to write it). Great library btw.","closed_by":{"login":"umazanatastatura","id":58152446,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4MTUyNDQ2","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/58152446?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/umazanatastatura","html_url":"https://github.com/umazanatastatura","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umazanatastatura/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umazanatastatura/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umazanatastatura/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umazanatastatura/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umazanatastatura/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umazanatastatura/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umazanatastatura/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umazanatastatura/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/umazanatastatura/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
