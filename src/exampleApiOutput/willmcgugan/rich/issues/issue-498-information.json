But given that rich is one of the most standout libraries for python, here's a long shot :smile: . \r\n\r\nI think it would be great if rich prompt can be enhanced to support advanced user inputs, something like [enquirer](https://github.com/enquirer/enquirer) in js. Although there are python libraries which currently try to cater to this request e.g [bulltet](https://github.com/bchao1/bullet), these libraries are very limited in being customizable or compatibility with jupyter notebooks etc. Since rich already has a great prompt, I was wondering if it could be extended to offer more enhanced features.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the great work.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
