Sorry to have taken your time, especially as the docs you pointed to specifically mention f-string issues!\r\n\r\nIt's difficult to suggest a different organisation that might help here - I think it's largely a matter of me just getting the hang of how things fit together better.  I've had a few cases where I know there's something documented and it just takes time to learn the mental model.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/671453309","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/162#issuecomment-671453309","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/162","id":671453309,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3MTQ1MzMwOQ==","user":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-10T16:21:35Z","updated_at":"2020-08-10T16:21:35Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"There were some recent changes that you might be interested in.
