This avoids potential conflicts between linters as pre-commit installs each linter on its own\r\n  environment.\r\n- To be reviewed after https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/348 is merged as it builds on top of it\r\n- Please note that while this change does not bring any apparent new feature, it does enable us to add and manage extra linters (like flake8 or pylint) much easier.\r\n\r\nFixes: #355","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
