The import example you gave is a good example of that.\r\n\r\n2) The Console.print isn't exactly a superset of builtin print. Builtin print has file and flush. Console.print has one file per console instance and doesn't need flush.\r\n\r\n3) I want to encourage use of a console object, ideally a singleton for the project. It exposes a lot more functionality that a single function, and is configurable.\r\n\r\nIf you want it, I'd suggest putting it in a file and doing `from my_project import print`. I wouldn't say that was clunky.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/678033017","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/244#issuecomment-678033017","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/244","id":678033017,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY3ODAzMzAxNw==","user":{"login":"bphunter1972","id":5446342,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU0NDYzNDI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/5446342?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bphunter1972","html_url":"https://github.com/bphunter1972","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bphunter1972/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bphunter1972/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bphunter1972/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bphunter1972/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bphunter1972/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bphunter1972/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bphunter1972/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bphunter1972/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bphunter1972/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-21T04:35:07Z","updated_at":"2020-08-21T04:35:07Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Fair enough.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
