Just discovered it and have been playing around with it this morning. \r\n\r\nI quite often work in JupyterLab / Jupyter Notebooks and most of the functionality seems to work and print fine as expected.\r\n\r\nHowever, when trying to employ the `rich.progress.track` functionality, or alternatively the `rich.progress.Progress` class, I can't get it to print the progress bar as output in the Jupyter Notebook.\r\n\r\nSo here's the code I've been trying:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom rich.progress import track\r\nimport time\r\n\r\ntotal = 0\r\n\r\ndef a_medium_speed_func(number):\r\n    time.sleep(0.5)\r\n    global total\r\n    total += number\r\n\r\nfor i in track(range(100), description=\"Processing...\"):\r\n    a_medium_speed_func(i)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's a super dumb function but just made it to see the progress bar working.\r\n\r\nI dug around and noticed a similar issue had been raised #26 and so I tried searching the docs and did find something that looked promising... [rich.console.Console - force_jupyer](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/console.html#rich.console.Console) so I tried the following code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom rich.progress import track\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\nimport time\r\n\r\nconsole = Console(force_jupyter=True)\r\n\r\ntotal = 0\r\n\r\ndef a_medium_speed_func(number):\r\n    time.sleep(0.5)\r\n    global total\r\n    total += number\r\n\r\nfor i in track(range(100), description=\"Processing...\", console=console):\r\n    a_medium_speed_func(i)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that still didn't work. I'm not sure if it is something I am coding wrong, or perhaps there is missing functionality so I thought I'd raise this issue. \r\n\r\nIf there's any more details you'd need from me let me know! I'm happy to help in whatever way I can.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
