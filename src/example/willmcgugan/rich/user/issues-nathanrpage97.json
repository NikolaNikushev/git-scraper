has been [interest](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues?q=is%3Aissue+live) in live updating when it comes to using rich.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nThe main goal of this is to provide an abstraction of the Progress feature that can be used with any `RenderableType` -- Live. \r\n\r\n## Progress\r\n\r\nI'm currently working on this in #382. \r\n\r\n![rich_live_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33010515/95882390-a5c62f00-0d47-11eb-96ea-41ed61971045.gif)\r\n\r\nSignificant portions of the code and logic from `rich.progress` have been re-used for the implementation.  There is a working example going with some extremely raw tests included `python -m rich.live`\r\n\r\n### Potential Areas of Concern\r\n- Lots of duplicate code exists between `Progress` and `Live`\r\n   - Perhaps they should share a common abstract parent class?\r\n- Limited by the height of the users console. \r\n   - Any tables or renderable larger than the display cannot be properly cleared (limitation of consoles). As such, the console begins to expand as parts of the \r\n   - There is a flag `hide_overflow` turned on by default, that will render \"Terminal too small\" when the renderable is too tall. This comes with some performance overheads of having to pre-render the Renderable to check its height.\r\n   - I'm curious if something along the lines of the `pager` functionality could be used on an oversized renderable\r\n\r\n### Tasklist\r\n- [x] Unit tests\r\n- [ ] Testing / considerations for an IPython console.

Whenever I used `LiveRender` it always faced any issues if something else was being logged.\r\n\r\nSo with that in mind I took what was there already from the `Progress` component and made a generalized Live Updating view. It allows for the component to be updated by the user with an `update()` function. It currently isn't threaded like Progress is, but could be expanded maybe with a LiveThreaded?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n\r\nIf the render component is too large, then it will start too not fully clear any of the Renderable above the console view. I have messed around with creating a `safe` flag that will have it print \"the terminal is too small\" instead when this is true. I didn't want to add it here yet before getting feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Showcase\r\n\r\n![rich_live_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33010515/95882390-a5c62f00-0d47-11eb-96ea-41ed61971045.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Some gist examples](https://gist.github.com/nathanrpage97/6eb6b92cc55a7536ad344709bfabe4e9)\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/260","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/260/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/260/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/260/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/260","id":689457902,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDc2NTAxOTYx","number":260,"title":"Add the ability to force terminal with environment variable","user":{"login":"nathanrpage97","id":33010515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDEwNTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/33010515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanrpage97","html_url":"https://github.com/nathanrpage97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanrpage97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanrpage97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanrpage97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanrpage97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanrpage97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanrpage97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanrpage97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanrpage97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanrpage97/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2020-08-31T19:43:58Z","updated_at":"2020-08-31T22:36:15Z","closed_at":"2020-08-31T22:36:15Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/pulls/260","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/260","diff_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/260.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/260.patch"},"body":"## Type of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug fix\r\n- [x] New feature\r\n- [ ] Documentation / docstrings\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Other\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I've run the latest [black](https://github.com/psf/black) with default args on new code.\r\n- [ ] I've updated CHANGELOG.md and CONTRIBUTORS.md where appropriate.\r\n- [x] I've added tests for new code.\r\n- [x] I accept that @willmcgugan may be pedantic in the code review.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nAdd the ability to set Console force_terminal from `FORCE_TERMINAL` environment variable.
