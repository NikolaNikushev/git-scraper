the bug**\r\nThis isn't exactly a bug, but rather some unexpected behaviour with `Confirm.ask()`.\r\n\r\nIn some situations I would like to confirm something with the user, but set the default response to _Yes_ instead of _No_. I thought I'd just stick in a `default=True` argument to the function to see what happens, and it _kind of_ works ðŸ˜… Hitting enter gives the default response. The problem is that the default is shown in brackets but the `[y/N]` suffix remains unchanged, instead of being `[Y/n]`.\r\n\r\nThis isn't really a problem for me - I'll just not specify a default (I actually prefer requiring an explicit response, but I was converting from `click.confirm()` which _always_ has a default). I just thought I'd flag the behaviour.\r\n\r\nFeel free to close if it's a feature and not a bug ðŸ˜„ \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom rich.prompt import Confirm\r\nif Confirm.ask(\"Do you like rich?\", default=True):\r\n  print(\"Is the correct answer!\")\r\nelse:\r\n  print(\"Boo\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ python test.py\r\nDo you like rich?
