encoding can mess some clients which may break the file encoding or render it incorrectly.\r\n\r\nExample: file that loads ok locally, after upload to S3 gets broken if the encoding is not mentioned in file.\r\n\r\nUse of UTF-8 is a very good practice, but we still need to mention it.\r\n\r\n```\r\naws s3 cp report.html s3://bucket/report.html\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe table drawing characters are those that are getting broken when not using UTF-8 but I can suspect that the same could happen with other Unicode characters too. [example](https://sbarnea.com/gri/ssbarnea.html) renders ok in Chrome but bad in Firefox, but once the charset is mentioned the issue is sorted.\r\n\r\nNote: I don't think I deserve a mention in

the bug**\r\nWhile this is an unlikely advanced use-case, I should better mention it, in hope we can find a workaround for it.\r\n\r\nThere is a shell trick that is used by some users in order to colorize output received on stderr with a different color, making easier to distinguish nature of output for programs producing output on both streams.\r\n\r\nThere are several implementations available as it may differ a little bit between platforms or shells but it mainly looks like https://github.com/cehoffman/dotfiles/blob/master/zsh/config#L174-L193  \r\n\r\nWhat happens is that stderr is redirected to an unnamed pipe before being added an ANSI coloring sequence for each line. \r\n\r\nThis works fine with one exception: programs that verify `sys.stderr.isatty()` as a side effect of this approach is that this is no longer reports true.\r\n\r\nPrograms that do use only `sys.stdout.isatty()` to determine if ANSI is supported or not are not affected, as ANSI still works on stderr.\r\n\r\nI am not yet sure which is the best approach to avoid this issue as I see pros and cons for all cases. I do see some users wanting to avoid ANSI on stderr, for example if they redirect output for log files.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/264","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/264/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/264/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/264/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/264","id":693225555,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2OTMyMjU1NTU=","number":264,"title":"[REQUEST] Allow borderless rendering of Markdown code blocks","user":{"login":"ssbarnea","id":102495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/102495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea","html_url":"https://github.com/ssbarnea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2200581776,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjAwNTgxNzc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/labels/Needs%20triage","name":"Needs triage","color":"bfdadc","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2020-09-04T14:25:04Z","updated_at":"2020-09-20T13:20:32Z","closed_at":"2020-09-07T09:42:17Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Currently when we print code blocks (3-backticks based) they always get a free ANSI frame.\r\n\r\n**How would you improve Rich?**\r\n\r\nThe presence of this frame prevents user from doing a copy/paste of that block because the ANSI frame characters will also be copied.\r\n\r\nPlease allow us to disable the frame rendering without preventing the code coloring, as this does not break the ability to copy/paste the code snippet.\r\n\r\nI propose adding a new parameter to Markdown rendered in order to control its behavior.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/253","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/253/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/253/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/253/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/253","id":685416890,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2ODU0MTY4OTA=","number":253,"title":"Document RenderGroup and render_group decorator","user":{"login":"ssbarnea","id":102495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/102495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea","html_url":"https://github.com/ssbarnea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2200581776,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjAwNTgxNzc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/labels/Needs%20triage","name":"Needs triage","color":"bfdadc","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2020-08-25T11:43:01Z","updated_at":"2020-09-12T13:37:20Z","closed_at":"2020-09-12T13:37:20Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I am facing an adoption issue caused by the fact that it seems not possible to treat rendable objects as string and concatenate them.

In fact, even if I switch to use console.print() in all cases I am unable to return what is to be printed because each rule renders as a table. That is why in my initial PR, I tried to do console.print(table) for each rule and return an empty string.\r\n\r\nObviously that my implementation is more of a hack, and not a nice one. Is there a better way to implement that?\r\n\r\nMy hope was that maybe `render()` would return a string that I can later print, but apparently it returns a generator, so clearly not something that I can concatenate and print later.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/237","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/237/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/237/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/237/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/237","id":681281602,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2ODEyODE2MDI=","number":237,"title":"Long term project maintenance plans","user":{"login":"ssbarnea","id":102495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/102495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea","html_url":"https://github.com/ssbarnea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2200581776,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjAwNTgxNzc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/labels/Needs%20triage","name":"Needs triage","color":"bfdadc","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-08-18T19:33:11Z","updated_at":"2020-08-20T09:16:44Z","closed_at":"2020-08-20T09:16:44Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I liked rich as soon I found it and I would like to start using it on several CLI tools I am maintaining, like [ansible-lint](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint/pull/971) or [molecule](https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). \r\n\r\nStill, I do have some concerns regarding long term future of the library as I see is hosted under a personal account. \r\n\r\nIf you do not mind could you mention:\r\n* are several cores available in case main contributor becomes unavailable?\r\n* how willing to accept new cores?\r\n\r\nPlease note that this question is about risk mitigation.
