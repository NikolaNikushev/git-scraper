the bug**\r\nIn the `ReprHighlighter` class, there seems to be a typo in the regex for IPV4 addresses:\r\n`r\"(?P<ipv4>[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-gt9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3})\",`\r\nThe third octet will also accept the letters 'g' and 't', which causes strings like '192.168.ggt.1' to be highlighted.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```python\r\n>>> from rich.console import Console\r\n>>> c = Console()\r\n>>> c.print('192.168.1.1')\r\n192.168.1.1\r\n>>> c.print('192.168.t.1')\r\n192.168.t.1\r\n>>> c.print('192.168.gt.1')\r\n192.168.gt.1\r\n>>> c.print('192.168.ggt.1')\r\n192.168.ggt.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee also

Linux\r\n\r\nWould it be viable to add some tests with valid and invalid strings for each regex to catch problems like this in the future?","performed_via_github_app":null}]
