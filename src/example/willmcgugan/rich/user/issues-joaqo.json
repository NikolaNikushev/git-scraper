first of all this library is really really great, thank you for the great work.\r\n\r\nAs for the subject of this post, I currently have a progress bar defined by:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nprogress_bar = Progress(\r\n    \"[blue]{task.description}\",\r\n    BarColumn(),\r\n    \"[progress.percentage]{task.percentage:>3.0f}%\",\r\n    TimeRemainingColumn(),\r\n    \"[yellow]{task.fields}\",  # <-- relevant part\r\n)\r\ntask = self.progress_bar.add_task(label, total=total_frames)\r\n```\r\nI am updating it with `bar.update(self.task, advance=1, fps=f\"{fps:.2f}\")` and it runs just fine, with the progress bar displaying my fps as part of a dict, which would look something like `{'fps': '6.60'}` at the end of the progress bar. This is a bit unsightly in my opinion, as I'd really prefer not to print it as a dict, with all its `{`s and `'`s. I would prefer to be able to chose exactly in what format my fields get printed in the progress bar.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to chose exactly which field to show and with what format, without printing as a dict? I tried things like `\"[yellow]{task.fields.fps}fps\"` or `\"[yellow]{task.fields['fps']}fps\"` but it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nIf this is not the case of me missing something obvious, it would be great to have this as a feature as it would allow us to chose how our custom fields look like.\r\n\r\nThanks for the awesome library by the way!","performed_via_github_app":null}]
