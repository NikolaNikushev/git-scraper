The pygithub package actually logs something along the following lines:\r\n`\"%s %s://%s%s %s %s ==> %i %s %s\"` (actually an URL with some additional data, the result of a request to the github API for some pull requests). However, when it comes to logging this, i get the following error : `MarkupError: closing tag '[//]' at position 27666 doesn't match any open tag` (along with an `KeyError: '/'`). \r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure, if this is a bug with rich or it's some unlucky interference with the way `pygithub` logs some things? \r\nSo this would be also my question: Is it possible to fix this with rich? Or should it even be no problem?\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nCode is like the following (as its actually the last lines log that produces the error).\r\n```\r\ng = Github(mytoken)\r\nrepo = g.get_repo('some/repo)\r\n# query all open PRs\r\nlog.debug('Querying open PRs to check if a sync PR already exists.')\r\n# iterate over the open PRs of the repo\r\nfor pull_request in repo.get_pulls(state='open'): # this is the line, where pygithub logs the thing above and the \"errors source\".\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Platform**\r\nWhat platform (Win/Linux/Mac) are you running on? What terminal software are you using.

Yes\r\n\r\n**How would you improve Rich?**\r\n\r\nThe goal of Rich is to enable users to create rich displays in the terminal. Instead of re-inventing the wheel, why not use existing industry standard technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to define the rich content displays? Web technologies are widely supported and existing frameworks such as Angular, React, and Vue are mature and certainly suitable for real-world workloads. Also, the technology stack has evolved to become increasingly suited towards web technologies: for example, [many processors have hardware support for JavaScript features](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0801/g/hko1477562192868). More close to home, entire [terminal emulators](https://github.com/vercel/hyper) have been built using web technologies. I think that we should not ignore the industry trend.\r\n\r\n**What problem does it solved for you?**\r\n\r\nThis allows would allow many developers to create UIs and displays using the technologies that are most familiar to them.

the bug**\r\nThis might be a duplicate of #119 but I'm opening it just in case because of the new `soft_wrap` option.\r\n\r\nWe are piping output from a program using Rich (specifically a Rich table) to another program. [Rich was correctly soft-wrapping when not being piped, but hard-wrapping at 80 chars when piped.](https://github.com/standardebooks/tools/issues/382) This makes it hard to process output through a pipe, because usually in a pipe we don't want any wrapping at all and we don't know in advance how wide the output might be. (In our case we always want the output to be as wide as the user's terminal, because the output is very verbose.)\r\n\r\nI tried passing `force_terminal`, both `True` and `False`, to `Console()` and the newer `soft_wrap=True` option to `console.print()` but neither did what I was expecting, and piped output was still hard-wrapped.\r\n\r\nUsing `COLUMNS` isn't a great solution because we don't want any wrapping and we don't know how long the output might be.\r\n\r\nIs `soft_wrap` supposed to solve this, and maybe there is a bug when using it to print tables? Or is this just not possible at all?\r\n\r\nIf `soft_wrap` is meant to solve this, then we can simply detect if we're in a pipe and pass that option accordingly. But if not, it would be very helpful to be able to specify `really_no_hard_wrapping_at_all_please` for cases like this. Piping output is a common use case and it is surprising to have output soft-wrapped at the CLI but hard-wrapped in a pipe.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```python\r\nconsole = Console()\r\n\r\ntable = Table(show_header=True, header_style=\"bold\", show_lines=True)\r\ntable.add_column(\"Code\", width=5, no_wrap=True)\r\ntable.add_column(\"Severity\", no_wrap=True)\r\ntable.add_column(\"File\", no_wrap=True)\r\ntable.add_column(\"Message\")\r\n\r\ntable.add_row(\"m-123\", \"Manual Review\", \"test.xhtml\", \"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31

99 100\")\r\n\r\nconsole.print(table, soft_wrap=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, run that program with `./path/to/program.py` to observe the expected output, and `./path/to/program.py | cat` to observe hard-wrapping.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot from 2020-12-15 10-51-23](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/866144/102245740-88d2e700-3ec3-11eb-8cd9-1829e58d5f49.png)\r\n\r\n**Platform**\r\n\r\n- Ubuntu

this feature request in itself is debatable as being a standalone use case in itself. But given that rich is one of the most standout libraries for python, here's a long shot :smile: . \r\n\r\nI think it would be great if rich prompt can be enhanced to support advanced user inputs, something like [enquirer](https://github.com/enquirer/enquirer) in js. Although there are python libraries which currently try to cater to this request e.g [bulltet](https://github.com/bchao1/bullet), these libraries are very limited in being customizable or compatibility with jupyter notebooks etc. Since rich already has a great prompt, I was wondering if it could be extended to offer more enhanced features.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the great

For example, currently you have a caret dependency on colorama ^0.4.0. Your package is young enough so that this covers all newer versions. But if colorama outputs a version 0.5.0, and another package would use ^0.5.0, this would lead to an unresolvable dependency - and that although very likely there is no issue at all. \r\n\r\nThe caret operator is very conservative, assumes a strict adherence to SemVer on the side of the dependency that is often not the case.\r\n\r\n**What problem does it solved for you?**\r\n\r\nForward looking action to prevent dependency resolution problems in the future for projects with many dependencies. Other languages can use ^ much better as they allow multiple versions of the same package to be installed, but python doesn't. So ^ will over the long run lead to incompatible dependencies.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/453","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/453/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/453/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/453/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/453","id":752800472,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3NTI4MDA0NzI=","number":453,"title":"Global suppress","user":{"login":"bandoos","id":32645954,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNjQ1OTU0","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/32645954?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bandoos","html_url":"https://github.com/bandoos","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bandoos/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bandoos/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bandoos/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bandoos/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bandoos/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bandoos/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bandoos/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bandoos/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bandoos/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2200581776,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjAwNTgxNzc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/labels/Needs%20triage","name":"Needs triage","color":"bfdadc","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2020-11-29T00:39:32Z","updated_at":"2020-12-03T19:09:10Z","closed_at":"2020-11-29T00:44:14Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hi,\r\nFirst of all thanks for the awesome lib!\r\n\r\nI tried looking around for this information but maybe i'm just missing it:\r\nIs there any way to suppress the coloring of output? so for example if I have\r\na program that is sometimes run in interactively (with coloring) and sometimes  in  a pipeline (so no coloring), so\r\ni'd usually have a --no-color flag. \r\n\r\nOf course this can be handled at higher level wrapping rich, but maybe I'm missing a simpler solution somewhere?

Still, I do think that the version compatibility range should not have a ceiling bound unless it is already known to break the library.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly problematic with rich which is mostly a library, so it needs to play well with other dependencies the project may need.\r\n\r\nLets assume you make 9.2.1 hotfix today to sort this issue. What happens if dataclasses makes release 0.9 tomorrow, it will likely get into conflict with rich again, even if there is no proof that they do not work together. This is even more problematic as the ceiling seams to be applied to the minor version.\r\n\r\nIf the concerns around possible breakage produced by dataclasses are real, at least the conditions should look more like `<1.0`.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/445","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/445/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/445/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/445/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/445","id":751572750,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3NTE1NzI3NTA=","number":445,"title":"[BUG] Pretty printing can break tuples containing a single item when expanding","user":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1668492270,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjY4NDkyMjcw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":"Something isn't working"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"assignees":[{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false}],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2020-11-26T12:59:36Z","updated_at":"2020-11-27T20:11:16Z","closed_at":"2020-11-27T20:11:16Z","author_association":"OWNER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"When pretty printing a tuple with one item, the pretty printing omits the comma necessary to make it a tuple.\r\n\r\nFor instance if you pretty print `(1,)` with `expand_all=True`, you get this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(\r\n    1\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is no longer a tuple.

I will also need some guidance on how to do that.\r\nI believe, I might need to duplicate+modify `test_track` test and call it `test_track_without_time_remaining`.\r\n\r\nP. S.

I've used it for the first time just now and I like it a lot!\r\n\r\nI don't think this exists, I spend ~30 min going through the docs and issues first.\r\nI thought #261 was the same, but that ended being about enabling demarcation between *all* rows, not selectively.\r\n\r\n**How would you improve Rich?**\r\n\r\nI think it would be useful to be able to add \"line rows\" to tables in order to create sections in tables.\r\nLike this:\r\n```sh\r\n┏━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━┓\r\n┃ Team   ┃ Task ┃\r\n┡━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━┩\r\n│ Team A │ Foo  │\r\n│ Team A │ Bar  │\r\n┡━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━┩\r\n│ Team B │ Foo  │\r\n│ Team B │ Bar  │\r\n│ Team B │ Bar  │\r\n┡━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━┩\r\n│ Team C │ Hur  │\r\n│ Team C │ Dur  │\r\n│ Team C │ Dur  │\r\n│ Team C │ Dur  │\r\n└────────┴──────┘\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that rich currently only allows you to add such lines to either all rows, as well as\r\nselectively for the footer and header row, but not to arbitrary rows.\r\nI've tried adding a `Rule` to every column of the row, but that doesn't give the same visual result.\r\n\r\nThere's probably a few different ways this could work:\r\n\r\n1. Adding a new `TableLine` object as a row to the table:\r\n```python\r\n# create table, add columns: skipped for brevity\r\ntable.add_row(\"Team A\", \"Foo\")\r\ntable.add_row(TableLine())\r\ntable.add_row(\"Team B\", \"Bar\")\r\n```\r\nMaybe `TableLine` isn't the best name, but I think the idea is clear :-)\r\n\r\n2. Add a optional `show_bottom_row`/`show_top_row` styling arguments to `add_row`\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# create table, add columns: skipped for brevity\r\ntable.add_row(\"Team A\", \"Foo\", show_bottom_line=True)\r\ntable.add_row(\"Team B\", \"Bar\")\r\ntable.add_row(\"Team C\", \"Bar\", show_top_line=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nA bit more generically, this could also work by passing a `TableRowStyle` (extends `rich.Style`) that\r\n\"understands\" table cell style language.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# create table, add columns: skipped for brevity\r\ntable.add_row(\"Team A\", \"Foo\", style=TableRowStyle(show_bottom_line=True))\r\ntable.add_row(\"Team B\", \"Bar\")\r\ntable.add_row(\"Team C\", \"Bar\", style=TableRowStyle(show_top_line=True))\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Add a `TableSection` object that can be stylized independently\r\n```python\r\nsection1 = TableSection(show_lines=True)\r\nsection1.add_row(\"Team A\", \"Foo\")\r\nsection1.add_row(\"Team A\", \"Bar\")\r\ntable.add_section(section1)\r\n\r\nsection2 = TableSection(show_lines=True)\r\nsection2.add_row(\"Team B\", \"Foo\")\r\nsection2.add_row(\"Team B\", \"Bar\")\r\ntable.add_section(section1)\r\n```\r\nThis approach is going a bit beyond my specific request and would need more thought. I just included it\r\nas it introduces the concept of table sections as a proper construct which might be useful for other use-cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What problem does it solved for you?**\r\nIn my case, I was trying visually split weeks from each-other in a table. Empty rows work, but I think lines might be\r\nmore visually pleasing.\r\n\r\nThanks again for creating rich and taking the time to read this far :)","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/417","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/417/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/417/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/417/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/417","id":732900285,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3MzI5MDAyODU=","number":417,"title":"[REQUEST]","user":{"login":"Schira4396","id":57404930,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3NDA0OTMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/57404930?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Schira4396","html_url":"https://github.com/Schira4396","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Schira4396/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Schira4396/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Schira4396/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Schira4396/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Schira4396/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Schira4396/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Schira4396/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Schira4396/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Schira4396/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2200581776,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjAwNTgxNzc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/labels/Needs%20triage","name":"Needs triage","color":"bfdadc","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2020-10-30T05:44:26Z","updated_at":"2020-10-31T13:47:53Z","closed_at":"2020-10-31T13:47:53Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hello, how does rich achieve multi-line refresh in place?\r\nI think that's pretty cool, is Curses used?

As such, the console begins to expand as parts of the \r\n   - There is a flag `hide_overflow` turned on by default, that will render \"Terminal too small\" when the renderable is too tall. This comes with some performance overheads of having to pre-render the Renderable to check its height.\r\n   - I'm curious if something along the lines of the `pager` functionality could be used on an oversized renderable\r\n\r\n### Tasklist\r\n- [x] Unit tests\r\n- [ ] Testing / considerations for an IPython console.

used to `fit` defaulting to `True` (without knowing about the measurement mechanism at the time), so I was initially confused as to what was creating huge measurements when I was rendering a nested renderable-like object.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/386","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/386/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/386/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/386/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/386","id":722013150,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTAzODM3MjU4","number":386,"title":"Bump

Whenever I used `LiveRender` it always faced any issues if something else was being logged.\r\n\r\nSo with that in mind I took what was there already from the `Progress` component and made a generalized Live Updating view. It allows for the component to be updated by the user with an `update()` function. It currently isn't threaded like Progress is, but could be expanded maybe with a LiveThreaded?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n\r\nIf the render component is too large, then it will start too not fully clear any of the Renderable above the console view. I have messed around with creating a `safe` flag that will have it print \"the terminal is too small\" instead when this is true. I didn't want to add it here yet before getting feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Showcase\r\n\r\n![rich_live_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33010515/95882390-a5c62f00-0d47-11eb-96ea-41ed61971045.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Some gist examples](https://gist.github.com/nathanrpage97/6eb6b92cc55a7536ad344709bfabe4e9)\r\n\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/381","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/381/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/381/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/381/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/381","id":719887256,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NTAyMDAxODQw","number":381,"title":"Bump colorama from 0.4.3 to 0.4.4","user":{"login":"dependabot[bot]","id":49699333,"node_id":"MDM6Qm90NDk2OTkzMzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/in/29110?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D","html_url":"https://github.com/apps/dependabot","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dependabot%5Bbot%5D/received_events","type":"Bot","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2225721610,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjI1NzIxNjEw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/labels/dependencies","name":"dependencies","color":"0366d6","default":false,"description":"Pull requests that update a dependency file"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-10-13T05:52:11Z","updated_at":"2020-10-14T10:40:19Z","closed_at":"2020-10-14T10:40:10Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/pulls/381","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/381","diff_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/381.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/381.patch"},"body":"Bumps [colorama](https://github.com/tartley/colorama) from 0.4.3 to 0.4.4.\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li>See full diff in <a href=\"https://github.com/tartley/colorama/commits\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=colorama&package-manager=pip&previous-version=0.4.3&new-version=0.4.4)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/configuring-github-dependabot-security-updates)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

I'm not too sure if this test is meaningful enough though.\r\n    * `test_rich_measure`: Checks whether the `__rich_measure__` method of `Table` returns the correct `Measurement` object for several cases\r\n    * Tried to add a test for lines 496-497, however I can't engineer a case where the code in `try` would raise a `ValueError`:\r\n        ```python\r\n        try:\r\n            second_max_column = max(\r\n                width if allow_wrap and width != max_column else 0\r\n                for width, allow_wrap in zip(widths, wrapable)\r\n            )\r\n        except ValueError:\r\n            second_max_column = 0\r\n        ```\r\n        Afaik, a `ValueError` would only be thrown by `max()` in a situation where an empty sequence is passed to it. But for us to get to the `try/except`, both `widths` and `wrapable` would have to be valid, which would in turn generate valid arguments for the `max()` function. Because of this, I'm not convinced a `try/except` for a `ValueError` is necessary in the function and hence removed it from the method..\r\n* `padding.py`\r\n    * `test_indent`: Tests the `indent` method of `Padding`. Also not sure if this test is meaningful enough.\r\n    * `test_rich_console`: Tests the output of the `__rich_console__` method\r\n* `containers.py`\r\n    * `test_lines_justify` Tests the outputs of the `justify` method for `Lines`\r\n    * It seems the `if next_word is None:` condition in line 156 of `conatiners.py` will never be triggered as `next_word` will only be `None` if `index == len(spaces)`, however the preceeding `if index < len(spaces):`  skips the execution of the `if next_word is None:` condition.\r\n    ```python\r\n    if index < len(spaces): \r\n            if

      next_style = next_word.get_style_at_offset(console, 0)\r\n                space_style = style if style == next_style else line.style\r\n    ```\r\n    Propose removing the if/else like so and have made a corresponding change in the PR:\r\n    ```python\r\n    if index < len(spaces): \r\n            style = word.get_style_at_offset(console, -1)\r\n            next_style = next_word.get_style_at_offset(console, 0)\r\n            space_style = style if style == next_style else line.style\r\n    ```\r\nLooking forward to your

the bug**\r\nIn the `ReprHighlighter` class, there seems to be a typo in the regex for IPV4 addresses:\r\n`r\"(?P<ipv4>[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3}\\.[0-gt9]{1,3}\\.[0-9]{1,3})\",`\r\nThe third octet will also accept the letters 'g' and 't', which causes strings like '192.168.ggt.1' to be highlighted.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```python\r\n>>> from rich.console import Console\r\n>>> c = Console()\r\n>>> c.print('192.168.1.1')\r\n192.168.1.1\r\n>>> c.print('192.168.t.1')\r\n192.168.t.1\r\n>>> c.print('192.168.gt.1')\r\n192.168.gt.1\r\n>>>

I suggest you to consider switching to binary prefixes (i.e. KiB, MiB, GiB, etc.) in order to have consistency with the number and its unit of measure and to remove the ambiguity regarding in which base the prefix is expressed: KiB, MiB, etc. are used exclusively with powers of 2, while I've seen KB, MB, etc. used with powers of 10 (as they should be) and powers of 2 (as in this case, but generally in casual conversations).\r\nFor instance, I tried with a file with a size of 6'988'379 bytes. Expressed in MiB it's 6,7 and this is the number printed by the progress bar, while in MB it's 6,9. As you can notice, while dealing with MiB vs MB the difference is ~5%, but when the size is bigger it can be ~7% (GiB vs GB), ~10% (TiB vs TB) and so on, so please consider using only one

However when the object being printed is a list, or a dictionary whose values are long lists/arrays `Pretty` prints the whole thing, cluttering the console and defeating the purpose of trying to have more informative tracebacks. \r\n\r\nI don't if I've missed this option, but it would be great if there was a way to truncate long objects when printing them. (I've tried using the `overflow` argument but didn't make a difference.\r\n\r\nHere's some code to reproduce the issue:\r\n``` python\r\n\r\nfrom rich.pretty import Pretty\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\n\r\nmy_list = [1] * 400\r\n\r\nConsole().print(Pretty(my_list))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally it would only print the start of the list. \r\n\r\nThank you,

now\nremoved:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>funcargnames</code> read-only property of <code>FixtureRequest</code>, <code>Metafunc</code>, and <code>Function</code> classes. Use <code>fixturenames</code> attribute.</li>\n<li><code>@pytest.fixture</code> no longer supports positional arguments, pass all arguments by keyword instead.</li>\n<li>Direct construction of <code>Node</code> subclasses now raise an error, use <code>from_parent</code> instead.</li>\n<li>The default value for <code>junit_family</code> has changed to <code>xunit2</code>. If you require the old format, add <code>junit_family=xunit1</code> to your configuration file.</li>\n<li>The <code>TerminalReporter</code> no longer has a <code>writer</code> attribute. Plugin authors may use the public functions of the <code>TerminalReporter</code> instead of accessing the <code>TerminalWriter</code> object directly.</li>\n<li>The <code>--result-log</code> option has been removed. Users are recommended to use the <a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-reportlog\">pytest-reportlog</a> plugin instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information consult\n<a href=\"https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/deprecations.html\">Deprecations and Removals</a> in the docs.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Deprecations</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6981\">#6981</a>: The <code>pytest.collect</code> module is deprecated: all its names can be imported from <code>pytest</code> directly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7097\">#7097</a>: The <code>pytest._fillfuncargs</code> function is deprecated.

would you improve Rich?**\r\n\r\nI love `rich`'s `ProgressBar`, but I have a very small issue with it: I can't seem to find a way to display `task.speed` without all the decimal numbers. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is how I'm defining my `ProgressBar`:\r\n```\r\nprogress = Progress(\r\n    TextColumn(\r\n        \"[bold magenta]Step {task.completed}/{task.total} - {task.speed} steps/s\"\r\n    ),\r\n    # \"[progress.description]{task.description}\",\r\n    BarColumn(bar_width=None),\r\n    \"•\",\r\n    \"[progress.percentage]{task.percentage:>3.0f}%\",\r\n    TimeRemainingColumn(),\r\n)\r\n\r\n```\r\nBut the `task.speed` get's printed with loads of decimal numbers which doesn't look great:\r\n```\r\nStep 44/3000 - 0.31283405731719177 steps/s \r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tried adding `>3.0f` to `task.speed` to truncate the float number, but this results in an error because before the first iteration is completed `task.speed` returns `None` and `None` cannot be formatted so that gives an error. \r\n\r\nIdeally `task.speed` should return a rounded number (e.g. to the third decimal) or a way should be put in place to have this option (even avoiding to return `None` before the first iteration would be enough). \r\n\r\nThanks, and thank for developing this awesome library

Type of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] I've run the latest [black](https://github.com/psf/black) with default args on new code.\r\n- [x] I've updated CHANGELOG.md and CONTRIBUTORS.md where appropriate.\r\n- [x] I've added tests for new code.\r\n- [x] I accept that @willmcgugan may be pedantic in the code review.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nMissing to specify encoding can mess some clients which may break the file encoding or render it incorrectly.\r\n\r\nExample: file that loads ok locally, after upload to S3 gets broken if the encoding is not mentioned in file.\r\n\r\nUse of UTF-8 is a very good practice, but we still need to mention it.\r\n\r\n```\r\naws s3 cp report.html s3://bucket/report.html\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe table drawing characters are those that are getting broken when not using UTF-8 but I can suspect that the same could happen with other Unicode characters too. [example](https://sbarnea.com/gri/ssbarnea.html) renders ok in Chrome but bad in Firefox, but once the charset is mentioned the issue is sorted.\r\n\r\nNote: I don't think I deserve a mention in CONTRIBUTORS.md

working on [an HTTP command line client using rich](https://github.com/encode/httpx/pull/1212), which is looking great, but I'm having a few problems getting the syntax highlighting just right.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I really want to use the whatever the existing console background colour is, but also want a theme that works well on both light & dark consoles, so need to also be able to use the default foreground text colour for at least part of the theme.\r\n\r\nAn example of a tool that gets this right is `httpie` - https://github.com/httpie/httpie\r\n\r\nTheir default theme is \"auto\" [which uses pygment's `TerminalFormatter`](https://github.com/httpie/httpie/blob/master/httpie/output/formatters/colors.py), and which results in a theme that has a different foreground text depending on the terminal style.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2020-09-15 at 20 37

rich.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, for cases where a user *does* explicitly select a theme, I'd ideally still like to use the terminal background, rather than painting over it.

to find a good way to get two things out of this...\r\n\r\n* The ability to use an \"auto\" theme, that uses standard ANSI colours, and matches the terminal theme.\r\n* Some public API for removing

The lack of consistency in styling is less than ideal.\r\n\r\nNote: I have looked at rich's own code to see if I could monkeypatch it (which I do for some other things in my project) and could not find an easy way to do what I would like it to do.  I've also used markdown with Sphinx, which uses Python as a default for code blocks and found that it too was not rendering inline code as Python code with the appropriate pygments theme. As far as I could tell, it does not look like something that would be easy to do and would completely understand if this issue would be closed with \"won't fix\".  However, if it looks like it **might** be possible to monkeypatch rich (and/or commonmark?) to do this, I would appreciate if I could get some pointers as I would be willing to experiment further on my own.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/257","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/257/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/257/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/257/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/257","id":688618494,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2ODg2MTg0OTQ=","number":257,"title":"[Question] Most idiomatic way to mix styles in same line.","user":{"login":"paw-lu","id":30049606,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMwMDQ5NjA2","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/30049606?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/paw-lu","html_url":"https://github.com/paw-lu","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paw-lu/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paw-lu/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paw-lu/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paw-lu/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paw-lu/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paw-lu/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paw-lu/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paw-lu/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/paw-lu/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2020-08-29T23:11:10Z","updated_at":"2020-08-30T14:09:32Z","closed_at":"2020-08-30T14:09:32Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Love the library, really thankful for your work here.\r\n\r\n## What I want to do\r\n\r\nUse two different colors on the same line.\r\n\r\n## How I currently achieve this\r\n\r\n[Following the documentation on styles](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style.html#style-themes) I use the markup api to achieve different colors, and it works great!\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\nfrom rich.theme import Theme\r\ncustom_theme = Theme({\r\n    \"red\": \"#FF0000\",\r\n    \"green\": \"#00FF00\"\r\n})\r\nconsole = Console(theme=custom_theme)\r\nconsole.print(\"[red]this is red[/red] [green]and this is green[/green]\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Question\r\n\r\nIs there another/better way to mix styles in the same line?

This seems related to recent https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/247 so I guess I am not the only one.\r\n\r\nI had code that produced both Markdown and tables and I wanted to display it all at once. \r\n\r\nBefore rich (or with classic ANSI) it was easy to concatenate the strings into a result and perform a print(result) at the end. \r\n\r\n**Details**\r\n\r\nI have practical example at https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint/pull/978/files where I am trying to print a list of rules using rich formatting. Our implementation allowed printing these using various formats where each format was a function returning a string.\r\n\r\nNow, with rich this really become an issue because I cannot return a string to be printed. In fact, even if I switch to use console.print() in all cases I am unable to return what is to be printed because each rule renders as a table. That is why in my initial PR, I tried to do console.print(table) for each rule and return an empty string.\r\n\r\nObviously that my implementation is more of a hack, and not a nice one. Is there a better way to implement that?\r\n\r\nMy hope was that maybe `render()` would return a string that I can later print, but apparently it returns a generator, so clearly not something that I can concatenate and print later.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/252","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/252/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/252/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/252/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/252","id":685343688,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2ODUzNDM2ODg=","number":252,"title":"is it possible to replace lines?","user":{"login":"jeyca","id":37297730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Mjk3NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/37297730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyca","html_url":"https://github.com/jeyca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2200581776,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjAwNTgxNzc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/labels/Needs%20triage","name":"Needs triage","color":"bfdadc","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2020-08-25T09:50:22Z","updated_at":"2020-08-28T16:21:36Z","closed_at":"2020-08-28T16:21:36Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I would like to build a custom progress indicator, very simple just a blinking `#` char at the first position of a line.

You will see that my logging does not have the colorised formatting.\r\n\r\n1. The width is somewhat constrained even though the width of my iTerm terminal window is plenty wide enough. Even when I widen it further, it remains constrained in its width.\r\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning that my project is in Docker, so I don't know if that's an issue. I have also tested reviewing the development server output within the stock `terminal` app in Mac OS which gave me the same result.\r\n\r\nThe timed grouping (with just the time element) and the warning levels both look good so it appears the Rich config is somewhat working.\r\n\r\n@willmcgugan For reference, do you have an exact commit reference that points exactly to the `settings.py` file you referred to in your blog post? Should it matter if it's in Docker instead of just Django's local development server?\r\n\r\nI don't know whether this is a config issue from my side, or whether there is a bug or missing feature from Rich itself.\r\n\r\nMy full logging config in my `settings.py` file is:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n...\r\n\r\n    LOGGING = {\r\n        'version': 1,\r\n        'disable_existing_loggers': False,\r\n\r\n        'filters': {\r\n            'skip_static_requests': {\r\n                '()': 'django.utils.log.CallbackFilter',\r\n                'callback': skip_static_requests,\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n\r\n        'formatters': {\r\n            'rich': {'datefmt': '[%X]'},\r\n        },\r\n\r\n        'handlers': {\r\n            'console': {\r\n                'class': 'rich.logging.RichHandler',\r\n                'formatter': 'rich',\r\n                'level': 'INFO',\r\n                'filters': ['skip_static_requests'],\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n\r\n        'loggers': {\r\n            'django': {\r\n                'handlers': ['console'],\r\n                'level': 'INFO',\r\n                'propagate': False,\r\n            },\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease could you advise?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nWayne","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/239","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/239/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/239/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/239/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/239","id":681870792,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2ODE4NzA3OTI=","number":239,"title":"are there themes for prompt?","user":{"login":"jeyca","id":37297730,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM3Mjk3NzMw","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/37297730?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyca","html_url":"https://github.com/jeyca","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyca/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyca/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyca/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyca/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyca/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyca/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyca/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyca/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeyca/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2200581776,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjAwNTgxNzc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/labels/Needs%20triage","name":"Needs triage","color":"bfdadc","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":4,"created_at":"2020-08-19T14:08:15Z","updated_at":"2020-08-22T10:44:43Z","closed_at":"2020-08-21T16:17:18Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I would like to change the text and style of the prompt error messages (like \"Please enter Y or N\"), I guess the text is not possible without hacking the source, but I wonder if I could change the default prompt.invalid theme.

Description\r\n\r\nAnother small contribution to #37 . I am not so sure about the last two tests, because I couldn't exactly pinpoint what the traceback is supposed to do in those cases. \r\n\r\nAlso: I added a `no cover` statement. I noticed that when I add a print statement before the `break`, both the `break` and the print are reached according to coverage (which makes sense). When I remove the print, the `break` isn't reached anymore. Not sure what happens there, might be a bug in ~~pytest~~ _coveragepy_?\r\n\r\nHappy to make some changes / additions to this PR. Let me know if you need or want it.

would like to suggest a different way to format tracebacks, which makes use of the virtualenv and project structure. Here is an example of what I'm thinking of.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nFile \"/home/mbarkhau/miniconda3/envs/litprog_py38/bin/litprog\", line 12, in <module> 12     sys.exit(cli())\r\n\r\nDirectory \"/home/mbarkhau/miniconda3/envs/litprog_py38/lib/python3.8/site-packages/\"\r\nFile \"click/core.py\", line    829, in __call__      return self.main(*args, **kwargs)\r\nFile \"click/core.py\", line    782, in main          rv = self.invoke(ctx)\r\nFile \"click/core.py\", line   1259, in invoke        return _process_result(sub_ctx.command.invoke(sub_ctx))\r\nFile \"click/core.py\", line   1066, in invoke        return ctx.invoke(self.callback, **ctx.params)\r\nFile \"click/core.py\", line    610, in invoke        return callback(*args, **kwargs)\r\n\r\nDirectory \"/home/mbarkhau/foss/litprog/\"\r\nFile \"src/litprog/cli.py\",      line 160, in build              lp_gen_docs.gen_html(built_ctx, html_dir)\r\nFile \"src/litprog/gen_docs.py\", line 294, in gen_html           wrapped_html = wrap_content_html(content_html, 'screen', meta, toc)\r\nFile \"src/litprog/gen_docs.py\", line 237, in wrap_content_html  result = tmpl.render(**ctx)\r\n\r\nDirectory \"/home/mbarkhau/miniconda3/envs/litprog_py38/lib/python3.8/site-packages/\"\r\nFile \"jinja2/environment.py\", line 1090, in render              self.environment.handle_exception()\r\nFile \"jinja2/environment.py\", line  832, in handle_exception    reraise(*rewrite_traceback_stack(source=source))\r\nFile \"jinja2/_compat.py\",     line   28, in reraise             raise value.with_traceback(tb)\r\n\r\nFile \"<template>\", line   56, in top-level template code\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsually the error is in the project code rather than in libraries, so I think it makes sense to group the traceback accordingly. During development I can also use a wide terminal and avoid interleaving different kinds of data (filepath, source text, filepath) and instead present it in a more tabular form. There are less lines of source in that case, but I'm not so sad about that. I think the main thing to help a dev identify is that the issue in this case is in `wrap_content_html` of \"src/litprog/gen_docs.py\", line 237 and everything apart from that, to a first approximation, is noise.\r\n\r\nThe two directories that I think are relevant to use as a cutoff are, `site-packages` and the

PYTHONIOENCODING=utf8\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that, the script runs perfectly fine with the beautiful rich progressbar.\r\n\r\nHowever, setting this env var in some environments might not be possible or have other undesired consequences. It would be great if there was some kind of failback mode, or a `WARNING` with a suggestion to set this var, instead of failing without further information.\r\n\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nUse the README progressbar example, let's call this file `progress.py`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom rich.progress import track\r\nfor step in track(range(100)):\r\n    pass\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun it with `ascii` encoding vs. `utf8` and check the difference:\r\n```bash\r\nPYTHONIOENCODING=ascii python progress.py  # Exception thrown\r\nPYTHONIOENCODING=utf8 python progress.py  # Works\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Platform**\r\n* `rich==5.0.0`\r\n* Probably works on any python3 installation. Reproduced on Python 3.6.10 on OSX Catalina, and Python 3.6.9 on Ubuntu Linux native and the same version on Linux for tegra (ARM) docker image.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/211","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/211/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/211/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/211/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/211","id":673527164,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDYzMzczMTgz","number":211,"title":"Fix deprecation warnings due to invalid escape sequences.","user":{"login":"tirkarthi","id":3972343,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzIzNDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3972343?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tirkarthi","html_url":"https://github.com/tirkarthi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tirkarthi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tirkarthi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tirkarthi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tirkarthi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tirkarthi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tirkarthi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tirkarthi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tirkarthi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tirkarthi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2020-08-05T13:09:45Z","updated_at":"2020-08-05T13:18:33Z","closed_at":"2020-08-05T13:17:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/pulls/211","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/211","diff_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/211.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/211.patch"},"body":"## Type of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix\r\n- [ ] New feature\r\n- [ ] Documentation / docstrings\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Other\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] I've run the latest [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) with default args on new code.\r\n- [ ] I've updated CHANGELOG.md and CONTRIBUTORS.md where appropriate.\r\n- [ ] I've added tests for new code.\r\n- [ ] I accept that @willmcgugan may be pedantic in the code review.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nFixes #210 \r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/210","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/210/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/210/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/210/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/210","id":673526078,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NzM1MjYwNzg=","number":210,"title":"[BUG] Deprecation warning due to invalid escape sequences","user":{"login":"tirkarthi","id":3972343,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM5NzIzNDM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/3972343?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tirkarthi","html_url":"https://github.com/tirkarthi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tirkarthi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tirkarthi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tirkarthi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tirkarthi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tirkarthi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tirkarthi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tirkarthi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tirkarthi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tirkarthi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2200581776,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjAwNTgxNzc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/labels/Needs%20triage","name":"Needs triage","color":"bfdadc","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2020-08-05T13:08:00Z","updated_at":"2020-08-05T13:17:39Z","closed_at":"2020-08-05T13:17:39Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nDeprecation warnings are raised due to invalid escape sequences.

It mostly works, except that the pulse style is not blue but fucsia:\r\n```\r\nfrom rich.bar import Bar\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\nfrom rich.progress import BarColumn, Progress\r\nfrom rich.table import Table\r\n\r\n\r\nprogress = Progress(\r\n    \"[progress.description]{task.description}\",\r\n    BarColumn(pulse_style=\"blue\"),\r\n    \"[progress.percentage]{task.percentage:>3.0f}% {task.completed} MB of {task.total} MB used\",\r\n)\r\n\r\nprogress.add_task(description='Storage', completed=5, total=10)\r\n\r\ntable = Table('Example')\r\ntable.add_row(progress.get_renderable())\r\n\r\nconsole = Console()\r\nconsole.print(table)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe questions are:\r\n- Is this a bug?\r\n- My intention here was the subclass the BarColumn class to modify the style based on the current percentage. Is this the way to go?\r\n\r\n**Platform**\r\nWhat platform (Win/Linux/Mac) are you running on? What terminal software are you using.

However, I notice that when you define the logging handler, the format of the message is decided by the private class LogRender. Whilst you can turn things on or off in this class, I notice you cannot reorder. \r\n\r\nThe default output looks great: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6748505/89188512-1e8b6b00-d5e2-11ea-8526-e9e121a27a4f.png)\r\n\r\nHowever if a user ever comes along and resizes the window (which I know happens all the time), the output becomes mangled due to the overflow wrapping caused by rich filling the horizontal buffer to right align the filename.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6748505/89188603-3e229380-d5e2-11ea-9260-50985f45597d.png)\r\n\r\nI was considering simply monkey patching the LogRender class and just updating the [pathing code](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/blob/master/rich/_log_render.py#L47) such that I could put the filenames at the start (to some fixed-width string), but it felt a bit dirty, so perhaps there is another way of doing it, or you'd be amendable to increasing the flexibility of the LogRender options?\r\n\r\nOn a similar note, I cannot find any examples of updating the ReprHighlighter and associated new styles in the documentation (though I might have missed it!), and given that they seem to be in different places after digging through the code (the Console object has the styling under the theme, and the syntax matching is done via extending the Highlighter) I feel like this would also be a useful addition! If theres a solution to the first issue I'd also be super happy to write up a bunch of customised logging examples and submit it as a PR if that sounds like a good idea to you!","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/201","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/201/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/201/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/201/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/201","id":671679085,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDYxODUyMzgy","number":201,"title":"Add black format check to ci","user":{"login":"nathanrpage97","id":33010515,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMzMDEwNTE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/33010515?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanrpage97","html_url":"https://github.com/nathanrpage97","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanrpage97/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanrpage97/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanrpage97/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanrpage97/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanrpage97/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanrpage97/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanrpage97/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanrpage97/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nathanrpage97/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2020-08-02T19:55:44Z","updated_at":"2020-08-04T09:08:48Z","closed_at":"2020-08-04T09:08:48Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/pulls/201","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/201","diff_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/201.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/201.patch"},"body":"## Type of changes\r\n\r\n- [ ] Bug fix\r\n- [ ] New feature\r\n- [ ] Documentation / docstrings\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [X] Other\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] I've run the latest [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) with default args on new code.\r\n- [ ] I've updated CHANGELOG.md and CONTRIBUTORS.md where appropriate.\r\n- [ ] I've added tests for new code.\r\n- [x] I accept that @willmcgugan may be pedantic in the code review.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nAdded a check for black formatting to ensure only formatted code is merged to the master branch.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/200","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/200/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/200/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/200/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/200","id":671306508,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NzEzMDY1MDg=","number":200,"title":"[QUESTION] Information on use of TerminalTheme with save_html","user":{"login":"jeremyschulman","id":2607956,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI2MDc5NTY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2607956?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyschulman","html_url":"https://github.com/jeremyschulman","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyschulman/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyschulman/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyschulman/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyschulman/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyschulman/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyschulman/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyschulman/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyschulman/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jeremyschulman/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2200581776,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjAwNTgxNzc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/labels/Needs%20triage","name":"Needs triage","color":"bfdadc","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":13,"created_at":"2020-08-01T23:45:49Z","updated_at":"2020-08-02T20:01:22Z","closed_at":"2020-08-02T15:37:17Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Have you checked the issues for a similar suggestions?

<strong>PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.</strong></p>\n<p>Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as\npossible, all warnings of type <code>PytestDeprecationWarning</code> now generate errors\ninstead of warning messages.</p>\n<p><strong>The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 6.1</strong>, so please consult the\n<a href=\"https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html\">Deprecations and Removals</a>\nsection in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.</p>\n<p>In the pytest <code>6.0.X</code> series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a\nstopgap measure by adding this to your <code>pytest.ini</code> file:</p>\n<pre lang=\"{.sourceCode\" data-meta=\".ini}\"><code>[pytest]\nfilterwarnings =\n    ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning\n</code></pre>\n<p>But this will stop working when pytest <code>6.1</code> is released.</p>\n<p><strong>If you have concerns</strong> about the removal of a specific feature, please add a\ncomment to <a

releases</a>.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2>6.0.0</h2>\n<h1>pytest 6.0.0 (2020-07-28)</h1>\n<p>(<strong>Please see the full set of changes for this release also in the 6.0.0rc1 notes below</strong>)</p>\n<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5584\">#5584</a>: <strong>PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.</strong></p>\n<p>Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as\npossible, all warnings of type <code>PytestDeprecationWarning</code> now generate errors\ninstead of warning messages.</p>\n<p><strong>The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 6.1</strong>, so please consult the\n<a href=\"https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html\">Deprecations and Removals</a>\nsection in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.</p>\n<p>In the pytest <code>6.0.X</code> series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a\nstopgap measure by adding this to your <code>pytest.ini</code> file:</p>\n<pre lang=\"{.sourceCode\" data-meta=\".ini}\"><code>[pytest]\nfilterwarnings =\n    ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning\n</code></pre>\n<p>But this will stop working when pytest <code>6.1</code> is released.</p>\n<p><strong>If you have concerns</strong> about the removal of a specific feature, please add a\ncomment to <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5584\">#5584</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7472\">#7472</a>: The <code>exec_()</code> and <code>is_true()</code> methods of <code>_pytest._code.Frame</code> have been removed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7464\">#7464</a>: Added support for NO_COLOR and FORCE_COLOR environment variables to control colored output.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7467\">#7467</a>: <code>--log-file</code> CLI option and <code>log_file</code> ini marker now create subdirectories if needed.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7489\">#7489</a>: The pytest.raises function has a clearer error message when <code>match</code> equals the obtained string but is not a regex match. In this case it is suggested to escape the regex.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7392\">#7392</a>: Fix the reported location of tests skipped with <code>@pytest.mark.skip</code> when <code>--runxfail</code> is used.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/commit/41a453959441d9b03cba3e47730efca27fa2f252\"><code>41a4539</code></a> Add link to 6.0.0rc1 changelog</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/commit/45ced1dc056d586fe3714823fa033cab27055c9f\"><code>45ced1d</code></a> Update doc/en/announce/release-6.0.0.rst</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/commit/1e4b8d447cfaaf4ee7c4636d2a03cf484d06f1cd\"><code>1e4b8d4</code></a> Prepare release version 6.0.0</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/commit/38029828d1d6bdc15b63a873142b1e91265e1a1c\"><code>3802982</code></a> Support generating major releases using issue comments (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7548\">#7548</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/commit/c2c0b7a5426ed74ba0df1bbc4997ffe45e302ccf\"><code>c2c0b7a</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7545\">#7545</a> from asottile/pylib_in_docs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/commit/9818899df4eacb65a4ec1397a93b5ebcf43e825c\"><code>9818899</code></a> remove usage of pylib in docs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/commit/3a060b77e81ebf990159e59cc8f8de26ad998e12\"><code>3a060b7</code></a> Revert change to traceback repr (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7535\">#7535</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/commit/7ec6401ffabf79d52938ece5b8ff566a8b9c260e\"><code>7ec6401</code></a> Change pytest deprecation warnings into errors for 6.0 release (<a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7362\">#7362</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/commit/a9799f0b35fe8fcc88ebd19b007cd2c6ac6b2a4f\"><code>a9799f0</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7531\">#7531</a> from bluetech/changelog-mypy-version</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/commit/102360b49051e7d2407003445157b0115ae18234\"><code>102360b</code></a> Merge pull request <a href=\"https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7519\">#7519</a> from hroncok/pytest_warning_captured_deprecated</li>\n<li>Additional commits viewable in <a href=\"https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/compare/5.4.3...6.0.0\">compare view</a></li>\n</ul>\n</details>\n<br />\n\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://dependabot-badges.githubapp.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=pytest&package-manager=pip&previous-version=5.4.3&new-version=6.0.0)](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-automated-security-fixes)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

the bug**\r\nThis isn't exactly a bug, but rather some unexpected behaviour with `Confirm.ask()`.\r\n\r\nIn some situations I would like to confirm something with the user, but set the default response to _Yes_ instead of _No_. I thought I'd just stick in a `default=True` argument to the function to see what happens, and it _kind of_ works 😅 Hitting enter gives the default response. The problem is that the default is shown in brackets but the `[y/N]` suffix remains unchanged, instead of being `[Y/n]`.\r\n\r\nThis isn't really a problem for me - I'll just not specify a default (I actually prefer requiring an explicit response, but I was converting from `click.confirm()` which _always_ has a default).

I've seen in your docs that you can pass the RichHandler() to `logging` to generate \"rich\" logs. \r\n\r\nhttps://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/logger.html#loguru._logger.Logger.configure\r\n\r\nHowever in my current project, we are using loguru, so I'm trying to figure out how to do a similar thing (if it's even possible), to pass RichHandler() to loguru, so I can generate these rich logs that are great.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if you could explain if this is possible, and if so share how it works, perhaps appending this detail to the rich docs [here](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logging.html).\r\n\r\nMy naive attempt at getting this to work:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom loguru import logger\r\nfrom rich.logging import RichHandler\r\n\r\nlogger.configure(handlers=[RichHandler()])\r\nlogger.debug(\"This is a debug statement\")\r\nlogger.info(\"This is an info statement\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I get fairly confused with the traceback. Hoping you may be able to enlighten me!\r\n\r\n**What problem does it solved for you?**\r\n\r\nIt would enable me to use rich formatting on logs in conjunction with the loguru package. Perhaps other users of loguru would be interested in this as well.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/162","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/162/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/162/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/162/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/162","id":660817325,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NjA4MTczMjU=","number":162,"title":"Console.print with f-strings featuring variables containing a list do not print the list","user":{"login":"nmstoker","id":3694484,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM2OTQ0ODQ=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/3694484?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker","html_url":"https://github.com/nmstoker","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/nmstoker/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":2200581776,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjAwNTgxNzc2","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/labels/Needs%20triage","name":"Needs triage","color":"bfdadc","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":5,"created_at":"2020-07-19T12:47:28Z","updated_at":"2020-08-12T00:38:27Z","closed_at":"2020-07-19T14:12:01Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"**Describe the bug**\r\nWhen using Console.print with an f-string featuring variables containing a list, the list does not get printed (but other non-list content from the variable is correctly printed).

The library has been incredibly easy to get up and running with great output and not much overhead. I had looked between blessed and some of the python TUI frameworks, and rich sits at a perfect spot between the two!  I was able to very quickly get some nice output going without much overhead at all and it's been great.\r\n\r\nThe documentation and examples have been great at helping me work through problems, but it's possible I missed this feature. I'm basically doing a menu for a user interface, so I've been using a combination of blessed and rich. I use the input from blessed, and have some functions to make the rich renderables when it needs to redraw the screen.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that you cannot clear between redraws because the screen will flash, so you have to draw over top of the existing items by moving home and redrawing. If elements get shorter, you are left with lines that have old output, so you need to clear to the end of the screen as well.\r\n\r\nSo right now my draw function is basically:\r\nprint.(blessed_term.home )\r\nrich_console.print( ui_element )\r\nrich_console.print( ui_element_2 )\r\n...\r\nprint( blessed_term.clear_eos )\r\n\r\nI think it would be a nice addition if it were possible to add some of these functions to rich, but I understand if they don't fit the design or are not easy to put in there. \r\n\r\nAnother suggestion is added features for the column class. The first would be to change the background color of the space between renderables in the column. \r\n\r\nThe screen layout I have is, top to bottom, an expanded panel, an expanded table, then a column of several tables, then an expanded panel. The column had a lot of space to the right that that was the color of the terminal background. If I expanded the column, the gaps were still the terminal background color.\r\n\r\nWhat I ended up doing was manually calculating the width of the tables (table borders + padding + width of longest string element), then creating a final panel with box minimal that was the size of the left over space (term width - tables width) that shared a background color with other elements, then added 0 padding, and I had a nice solid background color change for all elements.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to just set the background color of the space between the renderables in the column class.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it would be nice to justify the column elements to the left/right/center/justified positions. Left stacking them to the left, right to the right, center smashing them together in the center, and justify doing what it does now when expand=true. \r\n\r\nAgain it's been wonderful working with rich and thank you again for writing it along with great documentation.

I've recently created a few libraries that are helpful for extracting information from frames and tracebacks, and I think they could be very useful to rich.\r\n\r\n- [`executing`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/executing) can identify the exact AST node being executed by a frame in many cases. It's always disappointed me that Python only points to a line in each frame in tracebacks, especially when the expression/statement at fault spans many lines. Sometimes it can be really hard to interpret. Currently [executing is used in IPython](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/12150) (in master, unreleased) to highlight the node, here's what it looks like:\r\n\r\n![ipython](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3627481/75476425-3e6b9280-59a3-11ea-9b6c-b9e099475a45.png)\r\n\r\n- `executing` can also infer a function `__qualname__` from a code object, meaning your traceback can say `lorem/ipsum.py in MyClass.__init__ at line 123` instead of just `__init__`, which is much more informative.\r\n- [`pure_eval`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/pure_eval) can safely evaluate certain AST nodes without side effects, so that if the source for a frame contains expressions like `self.foo` and `bar[key]` their values can often be shown alongside plain variables. \r\n- [`stack_data`](https://github.com/alexmojaki/stack_data) collects data from tracebacks for the purpose of formatting and displaying them. It uses `executing` and `pure_eval` and also provides a lot of functionality of its own. [I integrated`stack_data` into IPython](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/11886) which allowed removing a lot of flaky custom introspection code, fixing several bugs and making the code more maintainable.\r\n\r\nFor rich, I'm thinking you could use stack_data to:\r\n\r\n- Reduce the amount of code in the repo.\r\n- More intelligently select which lines of code to display, instead of just a fixed number lines before and after.\r\n- Display the values of local variables and other expressions for each frame in a nice table.\r\n- Highlight the node being executed.\r\n- Show the code qualname.\r\n- Handle repeated frames, especially when the user gets a `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded`. Right now it gets stuck for a while before producing a massive traceback.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? If you want to know more I suggest looking through the stack_data README to get an idea of what it can do and how to use it.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/144","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/144/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/144/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/144/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/144","id":652375515,"node_id":"MDExOlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0NDQ1NDU1MDQ3","number":144,"title":"detect windows","user":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":0,"created_at":"2020-07-07T14:34:36Z","updated_at":"2020-07-07T16:09:07Z","closed_at":"2020-07-07T16:09:00Z","author_association":"OWNER","active_lock_reason":null,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/pulls/144","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/144","diff_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/144.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/144.patch"},"body":"## Type of changes\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix\r\n- [ ] New feature\r\n- [ ] Documentation / docstrings\r\n- [ ] Tests\r\n- [ ] Other\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] I've run the latest [black](https://github.com/ambv/black) with default args on new code.\r\n- [ ] I've updated CHANGELOG.md and CONTRIBUTORS.md where appropriate.\r\n- [ ] I've added tests for new code.\r\n- [ ] I accept that @willmcgugan may be pedantic in the code review.\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/140\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/143","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/143/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/143/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/143/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/143","id":652120883,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2NTIxMjA4ODM=","number":143,"title":"Styled tables are very slow vscode console","user":{"login":"erezsh","id":731464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMTQ2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/731464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erezsh","html_url":"https://github.com/erezsh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erezsh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erezsh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erezsh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erezsh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erezsh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erezsh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erezsh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erezsh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erezsh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":2,"created_at":"2020-07-07T08:34:21Z","updated_at":"2020-07-07T10:15:09Z","closed_at":"2020-07-07T10:15:09Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Here is a minimal script that reproduces the issue:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport time\r\n\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\nfrom rich.table import Table\r\n\r\ntable = Table(title=\"Test\")\r\n\r\ncolumns = range(20)\r\nfor i in columns:\r\n    table.add_column(str(i), style=\"green\")\r\n\r\nfor row in range(20):\r\n    table.add_row(*[f\"{row}-{i}\" for i in columns])\r\n\r\nconsole = Console()\r\n\r\nstart = time.time()\r\nconsole.print(table)\r\ntotal = time.time() -

a small handful of issues with detecting `WT_SESSION` and using that as an indicator that you can use advanced VT:\r\n\r\n* `WT_SESSION` is not an API, and it was my greatest fear when we introduced it that people would use it for feature detection\r\n   * This is why I (so far) refuse to add support for `TERM_PROGRAM` or `TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION`, and would rather us standardize on `TERM` :smile:\r\n* It _will not_ be set by other terminal emulators using the pseudoconsole API (like Visual Studio's terminal, which is built on the WT renderer and where they're considering shipping a copy of OpenConsole down to Windows 10 RS4)\r\n* Everything WT supports is supported by the conhost instance that it uses to back every tab\r\n* Every change to conhost (and therefore WT's VT support) flows back out through the Windows insider program and eventually lands for all console users in the stable builds\r\n\r\nIt's safer to use feature detection for the console.

thanks so much for this package! Just discovered it and have been playing around with it this morning. \r\n\r\nI quite often work in JupyterLab / Jupyter Notebooks and most of the functionality seems to work and print fine as expected.\r\n\r\nHowever, when trying to employ the `rich.progress.track` functionality, or alternatively the `rich.progress.Progress` class, I can't get it to print the progress bar as output in the Jupyter Notebook.\r\n\r\nSo here's the code I've been trying:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom rich.progress import track\r\nimport time\r\n\r\ntotal = 0\r\n\r\ndef a_medium_speed_func(number):\r\n    time.sleep(0.5)\r\n    global total\r\n    total += number\r\n\r\nfor i in track(range(100), description=\"Processing...\"):\r\n    a_medium_speed_func(i)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's a super dumb function but just made it to see the progress bar working.\r\n\r\nI dug around and noticed a similar issue had been raised #26 and so I tried searching the docs and did find something that looked promising... [rich.console.Console - force_jupyer](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/console.html#rich.console.Console) so I tried the following code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom rich.progress import track\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\nimport time\r\n\r\nconsole = Console(force_jupyter=True)\r\n\r\ntotal = 0\r\n\r\ndef a_medium_speed_func(number):\r\n    time.sleep(0.5)\r\n    global total\r\n    total += number\r\n\r\nfor i in track(range(100), description=\"Processing...\", console=console):\r\n    a_medium_speed_func(i)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that still didn't work. I'm not sure if it is something I am coding wrong, or perhaps there is missing functionality so I thought I'd raise this issue. \r\n\r\nIf there's any more details you'd need from me let me know!

In reality, it would be replaced with a log entry of w/ the result of the operation. Specifically, I'm using this in a \"searching\" context, so a search runs which may take a while to complete. I'd like to have a progress bar indicating what the application is doing, but replace this line with the search results after completion.\r\n\r\nThis almost works by using `progress.update(task_id, visible=False)`, but an extra new line ends up in the output, which causes weird gaps in the log output after completion (especially if a progress bar is used during two separate operations).\r\n\r\nIs there are way to remove the extra newline or completely erase the progress bar output, and return the cursor the the beginning of the original line?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n## Edit: I did some digging in the code...\r\n\r\nFrom what I can see, the table that is built to render the progress bar shouldn't have any rows if there are no visible tasks, and from looking at the `_render` method in the Table class, it shouldn't render any lines if there are no rows, so I can't quite track down why there is a new line happening anyway. I thought it may have been the \"padding\" argument supplied to the Table used to render the progress bar, but I tried to make that configurable and using `(0,0)` for the padding (vice `(0,1)`) and it still ends up with a blank line.\r\n\r\n## Edit 2: Example\r\n\r\nI realized in hindsight, my explanation may be a little lacking. This example code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\r\nfrom rich.progress import Progress\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\nimport time\r\n\r\nconsole = Console()\r\n\r\nconsole.log(\"Here we go!\")\r\n\r\nwith Progress(console=console) as progress:\r\n    task = progress.add_task(\"test\", total=10)\r\n    for i in range(10):\r\n        time.sleep(0.5)\r\n        progress.update(task, advance=1)\r\n    progress.update(task, visible=False)\r\n\r\nconsole.log(\"Is there a blank line?\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nProduces the following output after the progress has completed.\r\n\r\n```\r\n➜ python3 ./test.py\r\n[19:09:38] Here we go!                                                                     test.py:8\r\n\r\n[19:09:42] Is there a blank line?                                                         test.py:17\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd like there to be no blank line between the two log statements. The progress bar is only to indicate that a process which could hang is still working, and not for any lasting output that is helpful. \r\n\r\nHopefully that better describes the issue I'm having.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/109","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/109/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/109/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/109/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/109","id":635956069,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MzU5NTYwNjk=","number":109,"title":"The rule line goes to the second line when the parameter is Chinese or Japanese","user":{"login":"michaelfyc","id":45136049,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ1MTM2MDQ5","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/45136049?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfyc","html_url":"https://github.com/michaelfyc","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfyc/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfyc/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfyc/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfyc/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfyc/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfyc/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfyc/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfyc/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/michaelfyc/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1668492270,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjY4NDkyMjcw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":"Something isn't working"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2020-06-10T06:03:35Z","updated_at":"2020-06-10T13:49:28Z","closed_at":"2020-06-10T13:49:28Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"My code:\r\n```python\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\n\r\nConsole().rule(\"欢迎！\")\r\n\r\n```\r\nResult:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45136049/84232239-78ac0a80-ab22-11ea-91fa-a72f11f4a085.png)\r\n\r\nI tried Japanese as well, and encountered the same problem.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/108","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/108/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/108/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/108/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/108","id":635900032,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MzU5MDAwMzI=","number":108,"title":"rich.syntax: `code_width` parameter seems to be ignored when piping to file","user":{"login":"dannguyen","id":121520,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTUyMA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/121520?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannguyen","html_url":"https://github.com/dannguyen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannguyen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannguyen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannguyen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannguyen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannguyen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannguyen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannguyen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannguyen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/dannguyen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2020-06-10T03:31:47Z","updated_at":"2020-06-11T10:36:41Z","closed_at":"2020-06-11T10:36:41Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"> This is for Rich 2.0.0. And I'm running Mac OS 10.14.6\r\n\r\n> note: I may be terribly misusing Rich, and if my use-case is dumb, happy to close this and move on :)\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm using Rich's `Console.print()` as a drop-in replacement for a project's `print()` statement. The project is a command-line tool that collects JSON data from an API. Most of the time, the tool pipes the JSON data into a file; but for the times when I'm just testing out the tool and printing to Terminal, I'd like stdout to show the JSON with Rich's nice syntax coloring.\r\n\r\nHowever, when my tool prints to file, I've noticed unexpected/broken behavior when setting the Syntax() `code_width` parameter. The first part of this issue is me describing the bug. The second part of this issue is a tangential suggestion.\r\n\r\n## Possible bug in console.print/Syntax behavior when stdout is piped to file\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proof of concept\r\n\r\nHere's a dumbed-down proof of concept of my use-case, **without rich**\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport json\r\ndata = {'hello': 'world'}\r\ntext = json.dumps(data, indent=2)\r\nprint(text)\r\n```\r\n \r\n**With Rich**:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nimport json\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\nfrom rich.syntax import Syntax\r\ndata = {'hello': 'world'}\r\ntext = json.dumps(data, indent=2)\r\nsyntax = Syntax(text, lexer_name='json')\r\nconsole = Console()\r\nconsole.print(syntax)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**The problem:** When the JSON text features lines of >80 columns, **and** when I'm printing to file, `console.print()` seems to ignore the `code_width` parameter\r\n\r\n### mybar.py (default code_width)\r\n\r\nThe `mybar.py` script below is an example of a \"wide\" data payload being printed with the `Syntax()` class's default parameters, i.e. `code_width` left to `None` or whatever it normally is:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# mybar.py\r\nimport json\r\nimport string\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\nfrom rich.syntax import Syntax\r\ndata = {\r\n    'id': 1,\r\n    'things': (string.ascii_letters + string.ascii_letters),\r\n}\r\ntext = json.dumps(data, indent=2)\r\nsyntax = Syntax(text, lexer_name='json')\r\nconsole = Console()\r\nconsole.print(syntax)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo piping `mybar.py` into `bar-output.json`\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ python mybar.py  > bar-output.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults in `bar-output.json` being improper JSON, because there's a line break at column 80:\r\n\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{                                                                               \r\n  \"id\": 1,                                                                      \r\n  \"things\": \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmno\r\npqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"                                          \r\n}                                                                                                                                               \r\n```\r\n\r\n### myfoo.py (code_width set to 200)\r\n\r\n`myfoo.py` is the exact same script, just with the `code_width` parameter set to `200`:\r\n\r\n```py\r\n# mybar.py\r\nimport json\r\nimport string\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\nfrom rich.syntax import Syntax\r\ndata = {\r\n    'id': 1,\r\n    'things': (string.ascii_letters + string.ascii_letters),\r\n}\r\ntext = json.dumps(data, indent=2)\r\nsyntax = Syntax(text, lexer_name='json')\r\nconsole = Console()\r\nconsole.print(syntax)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ python myfoo.py > foo-output.json\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result, `foo-output.json` just **truncates** all data after column 80 – and that seems like unintended behavior?\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{                                                                               \r\n  \"id\": 1,                                                                      \r\n  \"things\": \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmno\r\n}                                                                               \r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that when printing to Terminal, the output is fine:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ python myfoo.py \r\n{                                                                                                                                  \r\n  \"id\": 1,                                                                                                                         \r\n  \"things\": \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ\"             \r\n}   \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Feature suggestion\r\n\r\nThis feature is tangential to the aforementioned bug: am I right in assuming that `code_width` default value is `None`? And that when printing to Terminal, the `None` value means: \"whatever the terminal's current width is?\".

I'm trying to get it with TextColumn, by updating it, however it doesn't seem like the progressbar works well with Text Column.  Everytime I try to use `add_task`, it puts it underneath the table, instead of to the right with it.  Is there a way I could do this, or is it possible there could be a way to put in variables, and update them?  Thanks.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/98","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/98/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/98/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/98/events","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/98","id":629264001,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU2MjkyNjQwMDE=","number":98,"title":"Display Pandas DataFrames","user":{"login":"cbrnr","id":4377312,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQzNzczMTI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/4377312?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbrnr","html_url":"https://github.com/cbrnr","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbrnr/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbrnr/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbrnr/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbrnr/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbrnr/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbrnr/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbrnr/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbrnr/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/cbrnr/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":1668492275,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNjY4NDkyMjc1","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":"New feature or request"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":6,"created_at":"2020-06-02T14:46:21Z","updated_at":"2020-06-18T12:41:20Z","closed_at":"2020-06-18T12:41:19Z","author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"I really like how R displays Tibbles (basically extended Data Frames) to highlight important features (such as missing values, negative values, column types), for example:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"939\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-06-02 at 16 40 42\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4377312/83533388-d2dc1880-a4ef-11ea-9ce4-7dd2165006a4.png\">\r\n\r\nThe same data looks much less exciting when printing the Data Frame in Pandas:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"815\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-06-02 at 16 42 24\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4377312/83533591-0f0f7900-a4f0-11ea-9339-e5e5a6222e43.png\">\r\n\r\nI was wondering if Rich could be used to create a Tibble-like representation (i.e. colorize the index column, missing values, maybe even include the dtypes for each visible column)?

This forced us to overload the create-method every time subclassing Heading so that we could reference the new subclass instead (or as I used, a self reference). By using the implicit `cls`-reference instead we don't need to overload the create method making code inheriting Heading DRY:er and less error-prone if create-method internals is changed in the future.

I want to say that this is a fantastic project, which I have only started to use.\r\n\r\nWhen working with (custom) tables, I found that the existing cell padding options did not fit my need: adding vertical padding at either the top or the bottom gave an unbalanced \"table\", whereas adding it at both top and bottom introduced too much vertical spacing between rows. I resorted to doing a formatting hack by not using vertical padding, inserting instead an empty row between each existing rows, so as to get the vertical spacing between rows just right (for me).

Unfortunately, the test target in makefile was not working, also I didn't know how to build an app locally on my laptop. So I decided to fix these problems\r\n\r\n**How?**\r\n\r\n- I made a `build` target in `Makefile` to allow everyone to build the app easily (I called that target in GH workflow). \r\n- I fixed a test target by adding `pytest-cov` dependency. \r\n- I fixed the dependency `sphinx-rtd-theme` for docs generation. \r\n- I split requirements into 'target' files and I put them into `requirements` directory.\r\n- I made a package from the tests directory to allow counting code coverage for the source code (And fixed imports of local modules in the tests)\r\n- I added `codecov` step for GH workflow and after merge to `master` we can add badge for code coverage in the `README.md` :)\r\n\r\n**Result?**\r\n\r\n- GH workflows should pass on three python versions\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9588315/81477296-51a6a400-9217-11ea-8bb4-adb53516e36e.png)\r\n\r\n- We can see the codecov step and code coverage
