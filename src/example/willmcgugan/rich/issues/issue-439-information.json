List every rich object that I use\r\n\r\n2. Wrap all rich objects in a `Rich(...)` object, that does nothing but signify the type\r\n\r\n3. Use `hasattr(obj, \"__rich_console__\")`\r\n\r\nThey all feel a little awkward to me, therefore my suggestion to support `isinstance`.\r\n\r\n**What problem does it solved for you?**\r\n\r\nIt will allow me to mix rich objects with objects from other libraries and from my own program, in a natural way.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"erezsh","id":731464,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjczMTQ2NA==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/731464?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/erezsh","html_url":"https://github.com/erezsh","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erezsh/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erezsh/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erezsh/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erezsh/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erezsh/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erezsh/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erezsh/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erezsh/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/erezsh/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
