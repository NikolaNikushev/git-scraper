Having it `PY_COLORS=0` means application will not use any ANSI codes and `PY_COLORS=1` will force ANSI mode regardless if terminal reports it or not.\r\n\r\nFor me personally is not a big deal as I already have code in applications I work with, but it would prove useful to have this directly into rich, so any user of rich would get this for free.\r\n\r\nAn implementation example can be seen at https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule/blob/20e1fa8a23308a9103e2dbdb4d3c4ae1ffe59c9d/molecule/logger.py#L42-L48\r\n\r\nThat is very useful feature to have when running on CI as you do not want to end-up defining 50-100 environment variables only to control ANSI behavior.","closed_by":{"login":"ssbarnea","id":102495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/102495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea","html_url":"https://github.com/ssbarnea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
