The only thing different from the usual Rich traceback would really need to be the \"Exception ignored in\" line that isn't present in regular exceptions.\r\n\r\n> You could potentially get a lot of these on exit if there is a bug in your `__del__`\r\n\r\nHmm, does Rich do something potentially expensive when showing tracebacks (some additional stack inspection maybe?)? Cause if that were the case and there are a lot of unraisable tracebacks, this could potentially slow down the exiting in which case it might be worth having it do something different. But since I don't know that much about what Rich is doing, I wouldn't want to speculate here too much.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/750917159","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/849#issuecomment-750917159","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/849","id":750917159,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MDkxNzE1OQ==","user":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-24T15:59:16Z","updated_at":"2020-12-24T15:59:16Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"It's not especially expensive, it just might result in a lot of scrolling text in the terminal.\r\n\r\nCome to think of it, it is a debug thing and probably should not be enabled default.
