Which is why they are stripped out. Not stripping it out of `end` was an oversight, but I'm inclined to leave it as it is for users who are certain they know what they are doing.\r\n\r\nMost of what you might user `\\r` for can be done with the new Live class, so it's not a great loss.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/749586115","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/845#issuecomment-749586115","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/845","id":749586115,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc0OTU4NjExNQ==","user":{"login":"codemicro","id":25284325,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjI1Mjg0MzI1","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/25284325?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/codemicro","html_url":"https://github.com/codemicro","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codemicro/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codemicro/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codemicro/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codemicro/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codemicro/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codemicro/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codemicro/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codemicro/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/codemicro/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-22T15:05:22Z","updated_at":"2020-12-22T15:05:22Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ah, that makes sense. In the situation I'm using it in, neither word wrap or alighnment are much of a concern, I'm just using Rich for the colours. The only plus I can see for `\\r` compared to the `Live` class is that it's super simple for this use case.\r\n\r\nThanks for the prompt reply!","performed_via_github_app":null}]
