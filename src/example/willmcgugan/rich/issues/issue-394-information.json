Based on the fact that `pretty.install()` takes a console option, I expected`hoped that pretty would use my theme if I did the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmy_console = Console(theme=my_theme)\r\npretty.install(console=my_console)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What problem does it solved for you?**\r\n\r\nIt would allow my custom console to have a consistent look and feel. Right now, I have a custom theme for displaying tracebacks  (done by redirecting `sys.stderr`). I would like to explore the possibility of using the same theme when displaying objects the way that pretty does.
