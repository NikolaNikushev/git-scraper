However, I notice that when you define the logging handler, the format of the message is decided by the private class LogRender. Whilst you can turn things on or off in this class, I notice you cannot reorder. \r\n\r\nThe default output looks great: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6748505/89188512-1e8b6b00-d5e2-11ea-8526-e9e121a27a4f.png)\r\n\r\nHowever if a user ever comes along and resizes the window (which I know happens all the time), the output becomes mangled due to the overflow wrapping caused by rich filling the horizontal buffer to right align the filename.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6748505/89188603-3e229380-d5e2-11ea-9260-50985f45597d.png)\r\n\r\nI was considering simply monkey patching the LogRender class and just updating the [pathing code](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/blob/master/rich/_log_render.py#L47) such that I could put the filenames at the start (to some fixed-width string), but it felt a bit dirty, so perhaps there is another way of doing it, or you'd be amendable to increasing the flexibility of the LogRender options?\r\n\r\nOn a similar note, I cannot find any examples of updating the ReprHighlighter and associated new styles in the documentation (though I might have missed it!), and given that they seem to be in different places after digging through the code (the Console object has the styling under the theme, and the syntax matching is done via extending the Highlighter) I feel like this would also be a useful addition! If theres a solution to the first issue I'd also be super happy to write up a bunch of customised logging examples and submit it as a PR if that sounds like a good idea to you!","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
