I am not so sure about the last two tests, because I couldn't exactly pinpoint what the traceback is supposed to do in those cases. \r\n\r\nAlso: I added a `no cover` statement. I noticed that when I add a print statement before the `break`, both the `break` and the print are reached according to coverage (which makes sense). When I remove the print, the `break` isn't reached anymore. Not sure what happens there, might be a bug in ~~pytest~~ _coveragepy_?\r\n\r\nHappy to make some changes / additions to this PR. Let me know if you need or want it. Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n**Edit:** formatting and small change in wording","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
