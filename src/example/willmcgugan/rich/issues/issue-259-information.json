Yes, unless I'm searching wrong, no one else has suggested this.\r\n\r\n**How would you improve Rich?**\r\n\r\nBeing able to just pipe something like a `Table` in and getting plaintext output out would be nice to have.\r\n\r\n**What problem does it solved for you?**\r\n\r\nI am currently attempting to make this library work with my Discord bot. It works great for i.e. tracebacks in console, and can also work with Discord's codeblock formatting in a way using `export_text()`: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8301262/91700639-d5283000-eb3b-11ea-98ba-0f3a4465a828.png)\r\n\r\n...
