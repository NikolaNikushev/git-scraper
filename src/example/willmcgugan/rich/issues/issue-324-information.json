The expected behavior would be to have a consistent formatting of these.\r\n\r\nApparently fully qualified paths are rendered correctly, but:\r\n\r\n* relative paths are only partially colored (first two dots are missed)\r\n* filenames without any path components are not highlighted at all\r\n\r\nAll these were printed using logging and simple strings. I tried to look if there is anything documented about how paths are rendered but I was not able to find info.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that some kind of hinting would be needed because it would be impossible to distinguish if a random string like \"foo\" is referring to a file or not. \r\n\r\n![sample](https://sbarnea.com/ss/Screen-Shot-2020-10-03-13-12-33.13.png)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
