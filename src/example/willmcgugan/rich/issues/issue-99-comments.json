However, the issue is that `progress.refresh` prints it out onto the console, but when it does that, it prints it under my settings table because the cursor does not start on the second column I have.  I tried making the tasks not visible at first, then making the table, then making them visible, but when it refreshed it, that made it print under the settings table again.  I tried starting as visible, and that worked a bit, but it printed the tasks before the table and such, which I don't want.  Either way though, when I call refresh on it again after changing it to \"Running...\", it would send it to underneath the table, since it's using `console.print` and the cursor is below the table.\r\n\r\nI'm starting to realize that I don't think this is possible due to the limitation of the console, and has nothing to do with this library.
