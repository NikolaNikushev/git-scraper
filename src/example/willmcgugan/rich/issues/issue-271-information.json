Example code of how you would like it to work would help.\r\n```python\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\nConsole.print('a\\tb')\r\n# prints 'a{tab}b', instead of 'a        b'\r\n```\r\n\r\n**What problem does it solved for you?**\r\nThe case I encountered is that `\\t` is used as a delimiter in `-a` value fish shell's complete command to separate a completion name and description. I want to use rich to print all possible combinations of completion names and descriptions like such:\r\n```text\r\ninstall\\tInstall a package\r\nlist\\tList all installed packages\r\nshow\\tShow info of given package\r\n```\r\nHowever, rich prints it with the tabs being replaced with spaces, which make complete command not recognize the descriptions.\r\n\r\nWhat problem do you have that this feature would solve? I may be able to suggest an existing way of solving it.\r\n\r\nMaybe set `tab_size` to `0` to preserve tabs?\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"pwwang","id":1188067,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExODgwNjc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1188067?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwwang","html_url":"https://github.com/pwwang","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwwang/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwwang/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwwang/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwwang/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwwang/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwwang/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwwang/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwwang/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pwwang/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
