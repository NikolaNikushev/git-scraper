Where this function would come into use is listing players, mods (if detected), etc etc. Considering this library is all about text formatting I think it would be fitting.\r\n\r\nIf you need any more details feel free to let me know.","closed_by":{"login":"tilda","id":8301262,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgzMDEyNjI=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8301262?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilda","html_url":"https://github.com/tilda","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilda/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilda/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilda/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilda/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilda/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilda/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilda/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilda/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tilda/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
