However this does not work, as the output is something like:\r\n```\r\nMyTitle of title1                        \\n┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━... PyPi.     │           │         │\\n└────────────────────────────┴────────────┴──────────────┴───────────┴─────────┘\\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo TL;DR: Is there any nice way to test the output of a table?
