Really awesome! \r\nJust read about it and couldn't wait to play with it. :smiley: \r\n\r\nI was trying to make it work in the Github Actions' shell (the online one) to get pretty colored text, but it seems to not be colorized somehow. :cry:  \r\n\r\nTrying to gather some info online lead me nowhere... Still clueless (the only - maybe - useful thing being https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/ANSI-color-output-in-webview/td-p/46226).\r\n\r\nPosting, as you may be already aware of the issue (although I couldn't find a closed or open one).\r\n\r\nAs to what's happening, and **how to reproduce**:\r\n\r\nI'm using code like this one:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\n\r\nprint(\"python print\")\r\n\r\nconsole = Console()\r\nconsole.log(\"console.log\", [1, \"str\"], 'https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/blob/9cba2027f4/tests/test_color_triplet.py', {\"k\": 'v', \"date\": '00:46:54'}, None, '2009-11-27T00:00:00.000100-06:39')\r\nconsole.print(\"console.print\", [1, \"str\"], 'https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/blob/9cba2027f4/tests/test_color_triplet.py', {\"k\": 'v', \"date\": '00:46:54'}, None, '2009-11-27T00:00:00.000100-06:39')\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd seeing this locally on my Windows box (via Cmder) - which is fine:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1266447/81127087-6811de80-8f3d-11ea-82b8-ab1058a82a60.png)\r\n\r\nBut then this is what shows in the Actions section on Github:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1266447/81182835-9ed40d00-8fae-11ea-8d94-ebdd41d6d0d7.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course I'm open to test on my end, whatever you think might be of help.\r\n\r\nPS: I've made a little repo to help reproduce the issue (https://github.com/azrafe7/test_python_rich_on_gh_pages)\r\nPlease let me know if and how can I help.\r\n\r\n...And thank you for your work.","closed_by":{"login":"azrafe7","id":1266447,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNjY0NDc=","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1266447?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/azrafe7","html_url":"https://github.com/azrafe7","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azrafe7/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azrafe7/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azrafe7/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azrafe7/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azrafe7/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azrafe7/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azrafe7/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azrafe7/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/azrafe7/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
