Pre- or post-processing, either way, this is just what I was looking for. Thank you!\r\n\r\nI am not yet familiar with your work - just saw it yesterday on HN. Really great! I was thinking the other day that such a technology would be neat to help me with a tool of mine that can report back into a GitHub issue (as a robot of sorts), but that can be also used stand-alone in the terminal, but then I need to support different output formats, which makes everything quite complex.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, I also noticed that tables are not rendered. Now, what I should say/wrote above, the markdown I want to render in the terminal is GitHub-flavored markdown, so nothing `rich` says it would render. I was thinking, I need to find the tables myself and invoke your table API directly or is there also a simple solution to tables, too?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/654793764","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/142#issuecomment-654793764","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/142","id":654793764,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NDc5Mzc2NA==","user":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-07T11:35:04Z","updated_at":"2020-07-07T11:35:04Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"The markdown renderer I use is \"commonmark\" which doesn't do tables.
