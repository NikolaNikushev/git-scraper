This is because if you have bitmap fonts selected in command prompt properties then the bars characters don't display properly. Rich has no way to know which fonts are in use, so it picks the safe default. Given how ancient cmd.exe is, I'd suggest switching to Windows Terminal and recommend the same to your users if they care about how the progress bars look.\r\n\r\nThe issue with `[[?]]` is likely because of the change to escaping in version 5. See the [docs](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/markup.html#escaping) for the new method.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/739314764","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/467#issuecomment-739314764","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/467","id":739314764,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczOTMxNDc2NA==","user":{"login":"lagmoellertim","id":11356497,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExMzU2NDk3","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/11356497?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagmoellertim","html_url":"https://github.com/lagmoellertim","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagmoellertim/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagmoellertim/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagmoellertim/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagmoellertim/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagmoellertim/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagmoellertim/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagmoellertim/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagmoellertim/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/lagmoellertim/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-05T16:04:38Z","updated_at":"2020-12-05T16:04:38Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thank you, can I somehow force the use of the prettier implementation?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/739333831","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/467#issuecomment-739333831","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/467","id":739333831,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDczOTMzMzgzMQ==","user":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-05T18:49:14Z","updated_at":"2020-12-05T18:49:14Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"There's nothing exposed to modify that I'm afraid.
