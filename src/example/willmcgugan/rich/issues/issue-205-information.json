This is a bit unsightly in my opinion, as I'd really prefer not to print it as a dict, with all its `{`s and `'`s. I would prefer to be able to chose exactly in what format my fields get printed in the progress bar.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to chose exactly which field to show and with what format, without printing as a dict? I tried things like `\"[yellow]{task.fields.fps}fps\"` or `\"[yellow]{task.fields['fps']}fps\"` but it doesn't work.\r\n\r\nIf this is not the case of me missing something obvious, it would be great to have this as a feature as it would allow us to chose how our custom fields look like.\r\n\r\nThanks for the awesome library by the way!","closed_by":{"login":"joaqo","id":14966348,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE0OTY2MzQ4","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/14966348?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaqo","html_url":"https://github.com/joaqo","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaqo/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaqo/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaqo/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaqo/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaqo/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaqo/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaqo/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaqo/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/joaqo/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
