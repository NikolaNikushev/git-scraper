I can do this part, but only by digging into private API...\r\n\r\n```python\r\nsyntax._background_color = None\r\nsyntax._pygments_style_class.background_color = None\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Ideally* I'd love to find a good way to get two things out of this...\r\n\r\n* The ability to use an \"auto\" theme, that uses standard ANSI colours, and matches the terminal theme.\r\n* Some public API for removing any explicit background colour on syntax highlighting, so only the text is colourised.","closed_by":{"login":"tomchristie","id":647359,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY0NzM1OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/647359?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomchristie","html_url":"https://github.com/tomchristie","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomchristie/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomchristie/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomchristie/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomchristie/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomchristie/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomchristie/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomchristie/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomchristie/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomchristie/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
