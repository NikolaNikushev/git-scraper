Would it be possible to also add a way to put something else instead of the path? I was trying out different options last night and since I didn't want the path to show, I ended up using that place to show the logger name. It is currently a bit of a mess though (I basically had to copy `LogRender.__call__`'s code in a subclass and use the path column for a logger name, and I also needed to do similar with `RichHandler`, so it is bound to break on some update eventually), because that part isn't currently easily extendable.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/750913625","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/850#issuecomment-750913625","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/850","id":750913625,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDc1MDkxMzYyNQ==","user":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-12-24T15:40:30Z","updated_at":"2020-12-24T15:40:30Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"> Would it be possible to also add a way to put something else instead of the path? \r\n\r\nYou can set the path, bit It would still style it as a link and add a line number.\r\n\r\nIt's wouldn't be that hard to completely customize it to your requirements.

It would be a lot nicer if RichHandler maybe had some method for getting formatted text to put in the column used by path (maybe called `get_right_column` or something like that?) so that I could just replace that when extending. Not sure how realistic that is, but it would definitely make it simpler.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
