The same issue occurs in tracebacks, but there the `max_length` keyword is not available when printing locals. Tracing the issue, the `render_scope` function uses `Pretty` but does not take or pass the `max_length` option. \r\n\r\nI wonder if making a global option or a console option (similar to a theme) would be a possibility without having to introduce yet another parameter to the logging handler (and in the code pass it down lots of levels).\r\n\r\n**What problem does it solved for you?**\r\n\r\nThe problem it solves is very long tracebacks in certain contexts where errors are thrown with local variables consisting of long lists or dictionaries.\r\n\r\nAnd thank you - rich is awesome!","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
