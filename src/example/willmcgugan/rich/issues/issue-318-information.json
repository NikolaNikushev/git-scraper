However when the object being printed is a list, or a dictionary whose values are long lists/arrays `Pretty` prints the whole thing, cluttering the console and defeating the purpose of trying to have more informative tracebacks. \r\n\r\nI don't if I've missed this option, but it would be great if there was a way to truncate long objects when printing them. (I've tried using the `overflow` argument but didn't make a difference.\r\n\r\nHere's some code to reproduce the issue:\r\n``` python\r\n\r\nfrom rich.pretty import Pretty\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\n\r\nmy_list = [1] * 400\r\n\r\nConsole().print(Pretty(my_list))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally it would only print the start of the list. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\nFederico\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
