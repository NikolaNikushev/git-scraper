Terminal links are a new feature (2017), but they were implemented in such a way that if they should be ignored by terminals that don't support them.\r\n\r\nI've tested links on Gnome terminal 3.28.2 on Ubuntu, which works fine. An upgrade may fix it, otherwise I think disabling links is your only option.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
