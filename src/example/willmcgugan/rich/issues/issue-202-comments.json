The strange resize behaviour is caused by Windows removing the last new line character if its at the edge of the terminal - which doesn't happen on OSX and Linux. \r\n\r\nI see why you would want to put the filename at the start, but I'm not keen on a fixed width column for the filename. You never can be certain what a sensible maximum is, and then what do you do if a filename + line is larger than the column.\r\n\r\nConfiguration is possible, but making everything configurable does make it harder to maintain -- and I'm not sure if the demand is there to make it worthwhile. I would lean towards making it easier to extend, and making the log render class public.\r\n\r\nRe styles, the docs on [themes](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/style.html#style-themes) cover how you can customize styles. There's also an [example](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/blob/master/examples/highlighter.py) that might help, and the code for [ReprHighlighter](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/blob/master/rich/highlighter.py#L69).\r\n\r\nWill","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/668301042","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/202#issuecomment-668301042","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/202","id":668301042,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY2ODMwMTA0Mg==","user":{"login":"Samreay","id":6748505,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY3NDg1MDU=","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/6748505?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samreay","html_url":"https://github.com/Samreay","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samreay/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samreay/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samreay/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samreay/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samreay/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samreay/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samreay/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samreay/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Samreay/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-04T00:12:25Z","updated_at":"2020-08-04T00:12:25Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Hi Will!\r\n\r\nYou are completely correct! I went back and tested this on windows cmd (resizing works great), windows powershell (works great), MacOS terminal (works great) and windows ubunutu terminal (makes me sad). Windows odd choices are definitely not on you, and I completely understand the potential issues with arbitrary filename sizing, so all good!\r\n\r\nIn terms of the styling, I was going to suggest an example where you update styles and themes in one place. I can see people wanting to use all the work thats been done in the ReprHighlighter, and add to it rather than replace it.
