In fact I do not even know what it does install as the package is not installed after:\r\n\r\n```\r\nssbarnea@imac: ~/c/os/rich feature/fluidlogger ⚡\r\n$ poetry install                                                                                                   Installing dependencies from lock file\r\n\r\nNo dependencies to install or update\r\n\r\n  - Installing rich (8.0.0)\r\n\r\nssbarnea@imac: ~/c/os/rich feature/fluidlogger ⚡\r\n$ python examples/log.py                                                                                           Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"examples/log.py\", line 6, in <module>\r\n    from rich.console import Console\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'rich.console'\r\nFAIL: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile I do respect your option for poetry, I think that ignoring the ubiquitous pip may become a deal breaker for increasing the number of contributors (they will want editable installs) or even users (normal installs, ones that are working fine now). At this moment I have 16 packages installed in editable mode as I often contribute back to dependencies that I use tools or libraries.\r\n\r\nMy experience with poetry is quite low and after reading https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/34#issuecomment-600021371 thread I got even more confused about what it does and how.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example reading output `poetry install --help` make me realise it does not claim to install any current package at all, it mentions what would do about dependencies but nothing about the current package/project itself. Is really poetry install a replacement for pip install?","performed_via_github_app":null}]
