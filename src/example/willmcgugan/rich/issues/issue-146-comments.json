The problem is that even with multiple processes, you only have one stdout stream.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to have a single Progress instance, defined inside your `if __name__ == __main__` block. Create tasks with `Progress.add_task` and call each process with the returned task ID. You'll then need to post updates from your processes back to the main process, via a \"pipe\" or \"queue\".\r\n\r\nYou should also be aware that you won't be able to print anything from your sub-processes, or it will break the visuals. Anything you want to print should be sent to the main process.\r\n\r\nHope that helps!","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/655604915","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/146#issuecomment-655604915","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/146","id":655604915,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1NTYwNDkxNQ==","user":{"login":"jpfeuffer","id":8102638,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgxMDI2Mzg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/8102638?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpfeuffer","html_url":"https://github.com/jpfeuffer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpfeuffer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpfeuffer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpfeuffer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpfeuffer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpfeuffer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpfeuffer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpfeuffer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpfeuffer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jpfeuffer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-08T15:53:10Z","updated_at":"2020-07-08T15:53:10Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks a lot.
