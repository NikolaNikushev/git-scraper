This is the code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\nfrom rich.table import Table\r\nfrom rich.text import Text\r\n\r\nconsole = Console()\r\n\r\ntable = Table()\r\ntable.add_column('Column1', justify='center')\r\ntable.add_row(Text('BAD', style='white on red'))\r\ntable.add_row('[white on red]GOOD[/white on red]')\r\ntable.add_row('Row', style='white on red')\r\n\r\nconsole.print(table)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\nThis is how it looks. Notice that in the first row, the style is applied to the entire \"cell\" whereas in the second row the style is only applied to the text, leaving the padding as is :\r\n![Sin título](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2606647/88194003-964eb280-cc3e-11ea-98ee-49fe247ffd9f.png)\r\n\r\nThis is how I would like it to show:\r\n![Sin título2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2606647/88194505-3573aa00-cc3f-11ea-9306-644d19b41393.png)\r\n\r\nI would rather use Text over markup because that way the code seems more readable.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug or I'm supposed to use markup inside a table?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n**Platform**\r\nLinux with Putty","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
