Yes\r\n\r\n**How would you improve Rich?**\r\n\r\nException raised during garbage collection/object destruction don't get raised in application's main context and are instead passed to `sys.unraisablehook` which is not injected by Rich and is therefore unformatted.\r\n\r\n**What problem does it solved for you?**\r\n\r\nIt allows me to see pretty-printed version of exceptions raised during garbage collection/object destruction.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing it's probably possible with right usage of `Traceback` object, but it would be great to have a built-in way to do so.\r\n","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
