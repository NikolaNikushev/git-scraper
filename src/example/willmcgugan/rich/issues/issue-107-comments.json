The emoji isn't going to be replaced in all handlers, and the function to do the replace is fast but not free in terms of cpu.\r\n\r\nIf you want emoji in your logs my suggestion would be to either copy RichHandler to your own project and customize it, or define a logging Formatter that does the emoji replace. The later is probably better because you could get emoji an all handlers.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/641437281","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/pull/107#issuecomment-641437281","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/107","id":641437281,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY0MTQzNzI4MQ==","user":{"login":"smacke","id":325653,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjMyNTY1Mw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/325653?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/smacke","html_url":"https://github.com/smacke","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smacke/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smacke/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smacke/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smacke/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smacke/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smacke/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smacke/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smacke/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/smacke/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-06-09T16:51:16Z","updated_at":"2020-06-09T16:51:16Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Ah that makes sense; I should have looked for a way to do this that didn't involve modifying code first.
