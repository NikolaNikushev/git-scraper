Whenever I used `LiveRender` it always faced any issues if something else was being logged.\r\n\r\nSo with that in mind I took what was there already from the `Progress` component and made a generalized Live Updating view. It allows for the component to be updated by the user with an `update()` function. It currently isn't threaded like Progress is, but could be expanded maybe with a LiveThreaded?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Limitations\r\n\r\nIf the render component is too large, then it will start too not fully clear any of the Renderable above the console view. I have messed around with creating a `safe` flag that will have it print \"the terminal is too small\" instead when this is true. I didn't want to add it here yet before getting feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Showcase\r\n\r\n![rich_live_example](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33010515/95882390-a5c62f00-0d47-11eb-96ea-41ed61971045.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Some gist examples](https://gist.github.com/nathanrpage97/6eb6b92cc55a7536ad344709bfabe4e9)\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
