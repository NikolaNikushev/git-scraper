Granted there are a lot of parameters on the handler, but It does seem to be the move obvious place for them. I do like the idea of some kind of configuration at the Console level, I'll think about it.\r\n\r\nI suspect that the logging handler should set a max_length and max_string by default.

I don't have any particular opinion about default string length. For max_length, 10 seems reasonable to me (it is e.g. also the default number of rows pandas prints for abbreviated tables) but 20 would also still be ok.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
