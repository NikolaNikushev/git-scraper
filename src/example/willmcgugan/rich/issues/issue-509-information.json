Yes\r\n\r\n**How would you improve Rich?**\r\n\r\nThe goal of Rich is to enable users to create rich displays in the terminal. Instead of re-inventing the wheel, why not use existing industry standard technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to define the rich content displays? Web technologies are widely supported and existing frameworks such as Angular, React, and Vue are mature and certainly suitable for real-world workloads. Also, the technology stack has evolved to become increasingly suited towards web technologies: for example, [many processors have hardware support for JavaScript features](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/dui0801/g/hko1477562192868). More close to home, entire [terminal emulators](https://github.com/vercel/hyper) have been built using web technologies. I think that we should not ignore the industry trend.\r\n\r\n**What problem does it solved for you?**\r\n\r\nThis allows would allow many developers to create UIs and displays using the technologies that are most familiar to them. This would allow for a myriad of code reuse opportunities, greatly enhancing the development experience.\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
