But I am planning on making it easy to change pager functionality, so I could even supply a pager that uses \"less -r\".\r\n\r\nEven \"less -r\" isn't without its drawbacks. It doesn't appear to support terminal links, at least not on macOS.\r\n\r\nFor a builtin pager, I was thinking cursor up/down and page up/down and that's it. That's as much as I ever use personally, and at least this would guarantee the same user experience everywhere.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/708647267","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/77#issuecomment-708647267","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/77","id":708647267,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwODY0NzI2Nw==","user":{"login":"Edward-Knight","id":13382553,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEzMzgyNTUz","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/13382553?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edward-Knight","html_url":"https://github.com/Edward-Knight","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edward-Knight/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edward-Knight/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edward-Knight/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edward-Knight/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edward-Knight/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edward-Knight/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edward-Knight/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edward-Knight/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Edward-Knight/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-14T20:38:55Z","updated_at":"2020-10-14T20:38:55Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I believe this is now resolved by #373?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/711289517","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/77#issuecomment-711289517","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/77","id":711289517,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcxMTI4OTUxNw==","user":{"login":"Dude-X","id":585003,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU4NTAwMw==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/585003?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dude-X","html_url":"https://github.com/Dude-X","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dude-X/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dude-X/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dude-X/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dude-X/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dude-X/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dude-X/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dude-X/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dude-X/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Dude-X/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-18T16:56:57Z","updated_at":"2020-10-18T16:56:57Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I think we can close this issue as far as implementing a pager.
