An update to the default style may need to also be considered.\r\n\r\n**What problem does it solved for you?**\r\nSeeing time Elapsed on long progress jobs is useful for understanding where the long running parts of the application are, and for the user to accept accuracy of the Time Remaining value.\r\n\r\nAlso, this would close the gap of similar metadata available on the default display of tqdm.  That could reduce an import.","closed_by":null,"performed_via_github_app":null}
