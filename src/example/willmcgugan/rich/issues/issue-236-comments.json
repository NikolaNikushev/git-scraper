If you have something like a table, where the formatting must be on a grid, you don't want the browser word wrapping and breaking output. This explains the difference in colors / font size, as Rich choses different defaults.\r\n\r\nWhen writing HTML in this way, Jupyter adds a padding around the output, which explains the spacing between the lines.\r\n\r\nYou may be able to reduce the spacing between the lines by using a shared Console instance as a context manager, which ensures the output is written in once chunk. Something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom rich import get_console()\r\nwith get_console():\r\n    log.info(\"working\")\r\n    do_work()\r\n    log.info(\"done\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can't speak for Google colab, I've never used it. But it does suggest that the api is not quite the same as Jupyter and its not using Rich's Jupyter support. You might want to try using `force_jupyter=True`.\r\n\r\nBy not using Jupyter support, colab will be converting the ansi color codes itself. It might look ok, but may break formatting in some cases. Especially if you resize the browser window to be a bit smaller.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
