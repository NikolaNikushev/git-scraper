That doesn't seem to me like the sort of thing that's good to work around, so I don't know if [`act`](https://github.com/nektos/act) is the best fit for local testing _for now_.\r\n\r\nAs for using [`tox`](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), your current `Makefile` setup seems really clean and simple to me. `make` also has the advantage of being nearly ubiquitous. The one advantage I see for adding `tox` is that if you have multiple Python interpreters installed you'll be able to run local tests for all of those versions.\r\n\r\nYour [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/blob/bb1153a13decefb94d86a713e0c236222beda0f2/CONTRIBUTING.md) already has instructions for installing other dependencies like [`pytest`](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and [`poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/), so adding `tox` doesn't seem _too_ onerous to me. That said, a `tox`-centric workflow would encourage a few changes...\r\n\r\nI propose the following.\r\n\r\n1. Add `tox` and [`tox-gh-actions`](https://github.com/ymyzk/tox-gh-actions) to `pyproject.toml`'s `tool.poetry.dev-dependencies` section.\r\n2. Add a `tox.ini` file with environments with their own dependencies for\r\n   - tests\r\n   - formatting\r\n   - type checking\r\n   - docs\r\n3. Remove `requirements-dev.txt`.\r\n4. Change the `Makefile` to invoke `tox` via `poetry run ...`.\r\n5. Change `.github/workflows/pythonpackage.yml` to invoke `tox` via `poetry run ...`.\r\n6. Change `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s documentation to reflect the above\r\n   ```markdown\r\n    ## Development Environment\r\n\r\n    To start developing with Rich, first [install `poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), and then run the following\r\n\r\n        poetry install\r\n   ```\r\n   after which developers should be able to either run `make test` or `poetry run tox ...` themselves.\r\n\r\nThe gist is that you should end up with a workflow where devs\r\n- don't have to manage virtual environments directly themselves,\r\n- can use `poetry` as a single entry point to the development workflow,\r\n- and if they have the right interpreters installed, test against multiple Python versions locally.\r\n\r\nIf you're cool with this, feel free to assign this issue to me and I'll get started ASAP. If you think it's too much and you'd prefer to keep the current `Makefile` workflow I wouldn't blame you at all. :sweat_smile:","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/704395166","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/295#issuecomment-704395166","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/295","id":704395166,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNDM5NTE2Ng==","user":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-06T16:24:00Z","updated_at":"2020-10-06T16:24:00Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"@reillysiemens Thanks for looking in to that!
