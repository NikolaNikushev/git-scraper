One can rename a level with an existing level number, or add a new level number and name.\r\n\r\n`level_width` is to define the width in the level column. If not given, the maximum with of all levels (including the ones defined by `level`) will be used. If the level name is longer than `level_width`, it will be cut.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```python\r\nimport logging\r\nfrom rich.logging import RichHandler\r\n\r\nclass MyHandler(RichHandler):\r\n    levels = { \r\n        logging.WARNING: 'WARN',\r\n        logging.ERROR: 'ERR',\r\n        logging.DEBUG: 'DBG',\r\n        9: 'FOO'\r\n    }\r\n    # If this is not defined, 8 will be used, since CRITICAL is the longest name\r\n    level_width = 4 \r\n\r\nlogger = logging.getLogger('rich_level_rename')\r\nlogger.addHandler(MyHandler(show_path=False))\r\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\r\n\r\nlogger.info('An info message')\r\nlogger.warning('A warning message')\r\nlogger.error('An error message')\r\nlogger.debug('A debug message')\r\nlogger._log(9, 'A custom message', ())\r\nlogger.critical('A critical message')\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1188067/97100342-9bf9d100-164f-11eb-9804-a84d29c1618d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","closed_by":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
