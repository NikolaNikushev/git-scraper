It's rare to need to pass a value in without processing it somehow. Floats would likely need to be formatted to a given number of decimal places, and you would rarely want the text 'None', 'True', and 'False'. Ints may be an exception, but even then you might want comma separators for thousands.\r\n\r\nRich uses type annotations, so you can catch this error before you run the code if you have Mypy set up.\r\n\r\nI would like to make error messages as clear as possible. How would you improve it?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/630827351","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/83#issuecomment-630827351","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/83","id":630827351,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDYzMDgyNzM1MQ==","user":{"login":"netllama","id":71113,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMTEz","avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/71113?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/netllama","html_url":"https://github.com/netllama","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netllama/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netllama/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netllama/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netllama/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netllama/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netllama/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netllama/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netllama/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/netllama/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-05-19T13:42:45Z","updated_at":"2020-05-19T13:42:45Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"I don't know what 187 refers to or means.
