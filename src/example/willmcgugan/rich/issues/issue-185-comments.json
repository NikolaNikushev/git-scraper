It is possible to define a style called \"hello\" -- so Rich can never be certain if you intended a literal \"[hello]\" or a style called \"hello\".\r\n\r\nThat said, I have been thinking of tightening the syntax for console markup, so the style name must begin with a letter. That would mean that your first example (and most repr strings) would be considered literals.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
