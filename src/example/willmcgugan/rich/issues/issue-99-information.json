I have one question though.  I'm trying to design a bit of a \"screen\" for my application, with two/three columns, with settings on the left, and the status of threads in the middle/right.  I'm trying to get it with TextColumn, by updating it, however it doesn't seem like the progressbar works well with Text Column.  Everytime I try to use `add_task`, it puts it underneath the table, instead of to the right with it.  Is there a way I could do this, or is it possible there could be a way to put in variables, and update them?  Thanks.","closed_by":{"login":"NeuroAssassin","id":42872277,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQyODcyMjc3","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/42872277?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeuroAssassin","html_url":"https://github.com/NeuroAssassin","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeuroAssassin/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeuroAssassin/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeuroAssassin/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeuroAssassin/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeuroAssassin/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeuroAssassin/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeuroAssassin/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeuroAssassin/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/NeuroAssassin/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
