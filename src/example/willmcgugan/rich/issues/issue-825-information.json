If you could override the input function like how the print function is, that would be a great improvement! I'd like to see something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninput('[bold magenta]Press ENTER to Continue[/bold magenta]')\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**What problem does it solve for you?**\r\n\r\nThis would solve using the `input()` function w/ rich to not break the style of your CLI. \r\n","closed_by":{"login":"M4cs","id":34947910,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjM0OTQ3OTEw","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/34947910?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/M4cs","html_url":"https://github.com/M4cs","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M4cs/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M4cs/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M4cs/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M4cs/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M4cs/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M4cs/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M4cs/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M4cs/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/M4cs/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"performed_via_github_app":null}
