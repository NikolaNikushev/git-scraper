Without auto refresh, the bar will be refreshed on each pass through the loop -- which is where most of the time is going.\r\n\r\nFrom your timeit results, the refresh adds around 12ms for each pass, which is unlikely to be significant unless you are doing virtually no work inside the loop. \r\n\r\nIf it is significant in a real world scenario, you can either run it in a terminal where the auto refresh ensures that the overhead is virtually nothing, or use the Progress class and call refresh() manually.
