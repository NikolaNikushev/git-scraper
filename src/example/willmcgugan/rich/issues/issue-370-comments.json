The pretty printing always ends on a new line, and may insert additional new lines if the collection doesn't fit in the terminal width.\r\n\r\nWhat is happening is that the strings are concatenated together (with sep). If a collection is encountered, it outputs the string + end + plus the pretty printed collection.\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to more closely match the builtin print, while still pretty printing. I'll give it some thought. In the meantime, if you want to replicate the builtin behaviour, you could convert any collections to a str.\r\n","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/706318014","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/370#issuecomment-706318014","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/370","id":706318014,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDcwNjMxODAxNA==","user":{"login":"char101","id":71255,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcxMjU1","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/71255?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/char101","html_url":"https://github.com/char101","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/char101/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/char101/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/char101/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/char101/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/char101/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/char101/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/char101/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/char101/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/char101/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-10-09T17:46:29Z","updated_at":"2020-10-09T17:46:29Z","author_association":"NONE","body":"Thanks for the explanation.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, for a simple print function, pretty printing data structures feels a bit too magical. The highlighting is nice, but printing a large data structures over multiple lines might not be useful in certain use case, like logging data processing execution. It is a nice feature to have, but I prefer to have control over it. Just like python have `pprint`, maybe rich can also provides print for line oriented printing and pprint for pretty printing.","performed_via_github_app":null}]
