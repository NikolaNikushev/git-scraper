Perhaps it's because one might do this and then hope it will still work everywhere:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    from rich import print\r\nexcept ImportError:\r\n    pass\r\n\r\nprint(\"This still works\")\r\nprint(\"But this doesn't\", justify='right')\r\n```\r\n\r\n**How would you improve Rich?**\r\n\r\nOh sure, one could do this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\nconsole = Console()\r\nprint = console.print\r\nprint('But this is clunky', justify='right')\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut, maybe offering the extended version of `print` without having to set up a console is better?
