That's why you are seeing the output not filling the full width of the terminal. Rich will also not render the control codes when its not connected to the terminal.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what your use case is, but Rich will insert new lines in order to word wrap text. The upshot of this is that you can't expect to print something like JSON with Rich and expect to parse the output as JSON. If you need that functionality, you can detect you are not writing to a terminal and instead write directly to the file.
