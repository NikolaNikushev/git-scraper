If your callable returns a renderable (which includes str), you can print that without converting to str.\r\n\r\nThere is an as yet undocumented RenderGroup class which turns a list of renderables in to a single renderable, in effect concatenating them. And a @render_group() decorator which combines a generator in to a render group.\r\n\r\nI think you could keep your pattern, with only small changes. Something like this...\r\n\r\n```python\r\nformatted_rules = _rule_format_map[options.format](rules)\r\nconsole.print(formatted_rules, highlight=False)  # You probably don't want auto-highlighting here\r\n```\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom rich.console import render_group\r\n\r\n@render_group\r\ndef rules_as_rich(rules: RulesCollection) -> Iterable[Table]:\r\n    \"\"\"Print documentation for a list of rules, returns empty string.\"\"\"\r\n    for d in rules:\r\n        table = Table(show_header=True, header_style=\"title\", box=box.MINIMAL)\r\n        table.add_column(d.id, style=\"dim\", width=16)\r\n        table.add_column(Markdown(d.shortdesc))\r\n        table.add_row(\"description\", Markdown(d.description))\r\n        table.add_row(\"version_added\", d.version_added)\r\n        table.add_row(\"tags\", \", \".join(d.tags))\r\n        table.add_row(\"severity\", d.severity)\r\n        yield table\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe render group stuff will be documented in a future update, I've only recently finalized the interface.\r\n\r\nIn general, there is very little reason to ever convert renderables to strings. The only use I've found for it is unit tests.","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/680207502","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/253#issuecomment-680207502","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/253","id":680207502,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY4MDIwNzUwMg==","user":{"login":"ssbarnea","id":102495,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMjQ5NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/102495?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea","html_url":"https://github.com/ssbarnea","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ssbarnea/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-08-25T18:50:34Z","updated_at":"2020-08-25T18:50:34Z","author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","body":"I think something is missing from this example because I was not able get it to work as you described.
