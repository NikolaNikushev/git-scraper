If you pipe the output to a file, Rich will strip the control codes but the formatting will be the same as if it was rendered in a terminal.\r\n\r\nThe upshot of this is that you generally can't expect to Rich.print JSON and have it parse as json.\r\n\r\nWhat you're seeing with regards to truncating the JSON is that Rich assumes a default width of 80 when it's not connected to a terminal. You can tell Rich to use a wider terminal by setting a `width` argument on the Console constructor -- but that's not a good solution to have parseable JSON.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to print a Syntax in the terminal, but write to a file otherwise. Something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif console.is_terminal:\r\n    console.print(syntax)\r\nelse:\r\n    console.file.write(json)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat way you can get pretty printed json in the terminal, but still write parsable JSON when piping to a file.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.\r\n\r\nWill","performed_via_github_app":null}]
