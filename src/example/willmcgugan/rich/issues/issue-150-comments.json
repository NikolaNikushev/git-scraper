Possible as a separate package. Currently the line of separation is that Rich is for rendering only and not interactive. I broke that rule with the Progress display, so we'll see.\r\n\r\n> -Column background color\r\n\r\nYou can set a style when you print something, which effectively does this. Try the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom rich.columns import Columns\r\nfrom rich.console import Console\r\n\r\nconsole = Console()\r\n\r\nfrom rich.table import Table\r\n\r\ntable = Table(\"foo\", \"bar\", style=\"on blue\")\r\ntable.add_row(\"1\", \"2\")\r\n\r\nconsole.print(Columns([table]*5, expand=True), style=\"on green\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr you can wrap it in `Padding(columns, style=\"on magenta\")`, which has a similar effect.\r\n\r\n> Column justify for elements left,right,center,justify\r\n\r\nI had thought the Align class does this, but its not working as intended. I should have a fix for this in the next version. Essentially you can wrap each column renderable in `Align.center(renderable)`. I'm not certain about making it a per-Columns attribute, but I'll think about it.\r\n\r\n> -Mention progress.get_renderable() out in main documentation.\r\n\r\nIt's `get_renderables` which is recommended for this, and it's mentioned [here](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/latest/progress.html#customizing). It doesn't go in to detail. Documentation PRs are welcome if you want to expand.\r\n\r\nIf you have any follow up questions, could you please open an issue per question. Makes it easier to track.\r\n\r\nNot sure I fully grasped what you are trying to display with Columns, so perhaps add a screenshot?","performed_via_github_app":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/comments/656777470","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich/issues/150#issuecomment-656777470","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/willmcgugan/rich/issues/150","id":656777470,"node_id":"MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDY1Njc3NzQ3MA==","user":{"login":"willmcgugan","id":554369,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU1NDM2OQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/554369?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan","html_url":"https://github.com/willmcgugan","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/willmcgugan/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2020-07-10T16:53:01Z","updated_at":"2020-07-10T16:53:01Z","author_association":"OWNER","body":"You may want to try v3.2.0.
